# Configure-time smoke for PULP_REQUIRE_GPU_FOR_SDK (pulp #1817).
#
# Verifies the two behaviors that protect the release pipeline:
#   1. With PULP_REQUIRE_GPU_FOR_SDK=ON + PULP_ENABLE_GPU=ON, configure
#      MUST fail when Skia binaries are absent, and the failure message
#      must mention "Skia binaries were not found".
#   2. With PULP_REQUIRE_GPU_FOR_SDK=OFF (the default) + the same missing
#      Skia binaries, configure MUST succeed — proving the gate does not
#      fire for developer builds, only for release builds that flip it on.
#
# This catches the pulp #1817 family of regressions: a release tarball
# shipping without GPU because Skia was missing at configure time and
# nothing failed loudly enough to notice.
#
# Strategy: configure in a tmpdir with SKIA_DIR pointed at an empty
# directory so FindSkia.cmake reliably sets SKIA_FOUND=FALSE — no need
# to stash/restore the developer's real external/skia-build/ tree.

# ── Case 2: default (OFF) must allow configure to proceed ────────────
#
# With PULP_REQUIRE_GPU_FOR_SDK=OFF (the default), a missing Skia must
# NOT block configure — developers building locally without Skia get
# a CG fallback build instead of a broken configure. Note we still
# point SKIA_DIR at the empty dir so the no-Skia state is reproducible.
#
# We don't run the full configure to completion (that would build SDL3
# etc. — too slow for a CMake smoke); instead we run with --check-stamp-list
# moot and just verify the first ~150 lines of configure output do NOT
# show the FATAL_ERROR. Implementation: run with `--log-level=ERROR` and
# `--graphviz=/dev/null` no — simpler: just run configure to completion
# but parallelize tests so the cost is amortized. The expected wallclock
# for this single-pass smoke is ~30s on macOS, similar to the iOS smoke.
