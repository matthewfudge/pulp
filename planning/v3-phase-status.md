## Remaining Phase Queue

Current recommended landing order:

- [ ] Phase 13 — Three.js / WebGPU JS bridge
- [~] Phase 13 — Three.js / WebGPU JS bridge (first truthful bridge slice in progress)
- [ ] Phase 14 — Final verification pass

Parked pending license-policy resolution:
- [ ] Phase 4 — Cmajor adapter
- [ ] Phase 5 — JSFX adapter
- [ ] Track final disposition in [#89](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/89)

## Phase 13 Readiness Gate

Before starting Phase 13 implementation work in earnest, prove the current merged prerequisites are actually sufficient:
- [x] verify `PULP_JS_ENGINE=quickjs|jsc|v8|auto` configure/build behavior on current `main`
- [x] prove `quickjs` and `jsc` build/test cleanly on current `main`
- [x] capture the real `v8` configure contract on current `main` (`V8_INCLUDE_DIR` + `V8_LIB_DIR` required)
- [x] prove `V8` really builds when enabled with external libs
- [x] assess whether the merged `JsEngine` layer already provides enough TypedArray support for the first readiness slice
- [x] raise and document the first host-object slice (native-backed object descriptors with properties + native methods)
- [x] raise and document the first promise slice (native callbacks surfaced as JS `Promise` objects)
- [x] write down the exact remaining deferred-async / bridge capability floor
- [x] define the first truthful Phase 13 test slice (engine selection, bridge smoke, then Three.js init)

Readiness note:
- Current evidence is recorded in `planning/v3-phase13-readiness.md`.
- Stock-checkout truth today is: `quickjs` and `jsc` are proven; `v8` is optional and dependency-conditional, but now has a real explicit provider path on this machine via Homebrew Node + `V8_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- Phase 13 should start as `v8`-preferred bridge work, while keeping the current engine-agnostic readiness smoke in regression coverage.

## Open MVP Blockers

- [ ] [#92](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/92) — add native WebView support on Windows and Linux so the Phase 7 API is not macOS-only in shipped form

## Sequential Chain: DSLs

- [x] Phase 3 (FAUST) → merged to main
- [ ] Phase 4 (Cmajor) → currently parked on licensing
- [ ] Phase 5 (JSFX) → blocked behind Phase 4

## Sequential Chain: Multi-window → WebView

- [x] Phase 6 (multi-window) → merged to main
- [x] Phase 7 (WebView) → merged to main with macOS-native proof; Windows/Linux parity deferred to [#92](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/92)

## Sequential Chain: Late phases

- [x] Phase 10 + 11 both merged → Phase 13 (Three.js bridge)
- [x] Phase 2 + 11 both merged → Phase 12 (offline video)
- [ ] All remaining shippable phases merged and 4/5 disposition explicitly tracked → Phase 14 (verification pass)

## Phase Completion Log

Record when each phase lands with notes on what was delivered vs what was deferred.

### Phase 1 — Contract/truth pass
- **Merged:** 2026-03-31
- **Delivered:** machine-readable validation contract (`docs/contracts/phase1-reality-snapshot.yaml`), truth pass on docs/planning, status labels, dependency map
- **Deferred:** nothing
- **Notes:** all subsequent phases reference this as the authoritative baseline

### Phase 2 — Validation harness + RTSan/vstvalidator
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`cf85cf8`)
- **Delivered:** validation harness improvements, `pulp validate --all` coverage, runtime sanitizer and validator plumbing, targeted proof path for later phases
- **Deferred:** final integrated verification remains Phase 14 work
- **Notes:** this is one of the dependency unlocks for Phase 12

### Phase 3 — FAUST offline codegen
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`898d561`)
- **Delivered:** `core/dsl` contract, FAUST wrapper layer, `PulpFaust.cmake`, FAUST examples/tests
- **Deferred:** Cmajor and JSFX adapters remain later phases
- **Notes:** this is the substrate Phase 4 and Phase 5 build on

### Phase 4 — Cmajor adapter
- **Merged:** —
- **Delivered:** —
- **Deferred:** —
- **Notes:** parked for now because the official Cmajor docs describe a dual GPLv3/commercial license, which conflicts with this repo's no-copyleft/no-commercial-dependency policy; tracked explicitly in [#89](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/89)

### Phase 5 — JSFX adapter
- **Merged:** —
- **Delivered:** —
- **Deferred:** —
- **Notes:** blocked on Phase 4 and the underlying DSL-licensing decision; future disposition also tracked in [#89](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/89)

### Phase 6 — Multi-window framework
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`130756a`)
- **Delivered:** WindowManager framework, shared state/theme hooks, multi-window plumbing and validation
- **Deferred:** WebView-specific embedding remains Phase 7
- **Notes:** this is the dependency unlock for Phase 7

### Phase 7 — WebView integration
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`ac9a8e2`)
- **Delivered:** native WebView bridge on macOS, bundled resource serving, host embedding seam, palette example, Monaco example, focused WebView tests, WebView guide, and `webview-ui` skill
- **Deferred:** Windows/WebView2 and Linux/WebKitGTK native backends remain follow-up platform work
- **Notes:** shipped scope is macOS-native only today; the cross-platform backend gap is tracked explicitly in [#92](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/92)

### Phase 8 — Audio visualization
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`de946d1`)
- **Delivered:** STFT/spectrogram/metering visualization foundation
- **Deferred:** later bridge/video work remains in Phases 12 and 13
- **Notes:** merged as a completed supporting subsystem

### Phase 9 — Widgets + assets + themes
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`1c2a6ae`)
- **Delivered:** theme presets, asset manager, contrast helpers, higher-level widget/theme surface
- **Deferred:** none specific beyond later verification
- **Notes:** forms part of the UI baseline for the remaining phases

### Phase 10 — JS engine abstraction
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`e2f7dda`)
- **Delivered:** JS engine abstraction with QuickJS/JSC/V8 backends and tests
- **Deferred:** production Three.js / Dawn bridge work and any later held-resolver async plumbing that real bridge work proves necessary
- **Notes:** this dependency is now backed by a proven readiness floor: typed-array proof, host-object descriptors, promise-returning native functions, and the first truthful browser-style bridge smoke slice

### Phase 11 — WebGPU compute exploration
- **Merged:** 2026-04-02 (`097d994`)
- **Delivered:** WebGPU compute feasibility slice and benchmark/proof work
- **Deferred:** production Three.js/WebGPU bridge remains Phase 13; offline video remains Phase 12
- **Notes:** this unlocks both Phase 12 and Phase 13

### Phase 12 — Offline video exploration
- **Merged:** —
- **Delivered:** feasibility report, explicit `HeadlessHost` transport-context stepping, and a macOS-first deterministic PNG-sequence proof
- **Deferred:** in-tree MP4/ProRes encoding, cross-platform capture parity, and GPU-faithful offscreen capture proof
- **Notes:** recommendation is to proceed only as a library-first / PNG-sequence capability if followed up; do not overclaim a shipped offline-video feature yet

### Phase 13 — Three.js / WebGPU JS bridge
- **Merged:** —
- **Delivered:** in-progress first truthful slice on the branch: `HTMLCanvasElement` `getContext('2d')`, explicit `getContext('webgpu') === null`, and `window.pulp.gpu.getInfo()` backed by native truth
- **Deferred:** —
- **Notes:** prerequisites and readiness floor are now proven; implementation has started from a narrow browser-style slice before any Three.js claim. DOM `id` and native widget `_id` parity is still deferred; current focused proof uses DOM lookup for the public surface and native `_id` for bridge/widget assertions.

### Phase 14 — Verification pass
- **Merged:** —
- **Delivered:** —
- **Deferred:** —
- **Notes:** final end-to-end verification remains after Phases 12 and 13, plus explicit disposition tracking for the parked Cmajor/JSFX phases ([#89](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/89)) and the deferred Windows/Linux WebView parity gap ([#92](https://github.com/danielraffel/pulp/issues/92))
