### Branch & Worktree

Android work lives on `feature/android-targeting`, typically in a worktree at `../pulp-android`:

```bash
# Create worktree (if not already present)
git worktree add ../pulp-android feature/android-targeting

# Always work in the worktree, not the main repo
cd ../pulp-android
```

## Build

### Cross-compile for Android

```bash
# NDK must be installed (Android Studio SDK Manager or standalone)
# Set NDK path — typically:
export ANDROID_NDK=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/30.0.8

# Configure for Android arm64
cmake -S . -B build-android \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake \
  -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
  -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=26 \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build
cmake --build build-android -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

### Build the APK

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
# Output: android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Host build (for tests)

```bash
# Regular host build still works in the android worktree
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Deploy & Test on Emulator

### Start emulator

```bash
# List available AVDs
emulator -list-avds

# Start (use -wipe-data if StorageManager is corrupted)
emulator -avd Medium_Phone_API_36 -gpu swiftshader_indirect &

# Wait for boot
adb wait-for-device
adb shell getprop sys.boot_completed  # returns "1" when ready
```

### Install and launch

```bash
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.pulp/.PulpActivity

# If killed for slow start (Dawn init takes 3+ seconds), just retry:
adb shell am start -n com.pulp/.PulpActivity
```

### Screenshot verification

```bash
adb exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/pulp-android.png
# View with: open /tmp/pulp-android.png
```

### Touch testing via adb

```bash
# Tap at coordinates (dp)
adb shell input tap 200 400

# Drag (swipe) from point A to point B over 300ms
adb shell input swipe 200 400 200 300 300

# Take screenshot after to verify state changed
sleep 0.5 && adb exec-out screencap -p > /tmp/after-tap.png
```

### Logcat

```bash
# Filter to Pulp logs
adb logcat -s PulpAudio PulpRender Pulp

# Clear and watch
adb logcat -c && adb logcat -s Pulp
```

## Critical Gotchas

These are hard-won lessons from the bringup. Violating any of these will cause crashes or subtle bugs.

### Platform Detection Order

```cpp
// WRONG — __linux__ matches Android too!
#if defined(__linux__)
    // Linux code...
#elif defined(__ANDROID__)
    // Never reached!

// RIGHT — check Android first
#if defined(__ANDROID__)
    // Android code...
#elif defined(__linux__)
    // Linux code...
```

In CMake, `ANDROID` must be checked before `UNIX` for the same reason.

### No posix_spawn on Android

Android Bionic doesn't have `posix_spawn`. Use `fork`/`exec` instead. The `ChildProcess` subsystem already handles this with `#ifdef __ANDROID__` guards.

### Vulkan Swapchain Format

Android Vulkan uses **RGBA8**, not BGRA8 (which macOS/desktop Vulkan uses). The Dawn backend texture info must match exactly, or Skia canvas operations (especially text rendering) will crash or produce garbage.

### SkiaSurface Scaling — Don't Double-Scale

`SkiaSurface` applies `scale_factor` internally via `canvas->scale()`. If you also call `canvas->scale(density, density)` in your render function, everything renders 2x too large.

```cpp
// WRONG
canvas->scale(density, density);  // SkiaSurface already did this!
root->paint(*canvas);

// RIGHT — just paint, SkiaSurface handles the scale
root->paint(*canvas);
```

### Touch Coordinate Conversion

Android touch events arrive in physical pixels. Convert to dp before hit-testing:

```cpp
float dp_x = pixel_x / display_density;
float dp_y = pixel_y / display_density;
auto* hit = root->hit_test({dp_x, dp_y});
```

Then convert dp to view-local coordinates by walking up the parent chain:

```cpp
static view::Point to_local(view::View* target, float dp_x, float dp_y) {
    float abs_x = 0, abs_y = 0;
    for (auto* v = target; v != nullptr; v = v->parent()) {
        abs_x += v->bounds().x;
        abs_y += v->bounds().y;
    }
    return {dp_x - abs_x, dp_y - abs_y};
}
```

### MouseEvent Dispatch — Both Rich and Legacy

Some widgets (like Fader) use `on_mouse_event(MouseEvent)` to track drag state. Others use the simple `on_mouse_down(Point)`. Always dispatch both:

```cpp
view::MouseEvent ev;
ev.position = local;
ev.window_position = dp;
ev.button = view::MouseButton::left;
ev.pointer_type = view::PointerType::touch;
ev.pressure = pressure;
ev.is_down = true;
ev.click_count = click_count;

hit->on_mouse_event(ev);   // Rich event (Fader needs this)
hit->on_mouse_down(local);  // Legacy event (Toggle, Knob need this)
```

### Fader Orientation Default

`Fader::orientation_` defaults to `Orientation::vertical`. If you want horizontal faders, set explicitly:

```cpp
fader->set_orientation(Fader::Orientation::horizontal);
```

### View Hierarchy Depth and Flex Layout

Deeply nested Panel containers (Panel > Panel > Widget) break flex layout propagation — child bounds remain {0,0,0,0} and hit_test returns the parent Panel instead of the widget. Keep hierarchies flat:

```cpp
// WRONG — nested wrappers break layout
auto wrapper = std::make_shared<Panel>();
auto inner = std::make_shared<Panel>();
inner->add_child(knob);
wrapper->add_child(inner);
root->add_child(wrapper);

// RIGHT — add directly or one level deep
auto row = std::make_shared<Panel>();
row->add_child(knob1);
row->add_child(knob2);
root->add_child(row);
```

### Don't Call layout_children() on Sub-Panels Early

Calling `layout_children()` on a sub-panel before it has been assigned bounds by its parent's layout pass will hang or produce zero-size children. Only call `layout_children()` on the root after setting root bounds.

### JNI Symbol Export

Use `--whole-archive` when linking `libpulp.so` to ensure JNI symbols are exported:

```cmake
target_link_options(pulp-jni PRIVATE
    -Wl,--whole-archive $<TARGET_FILE:pulp-platform> -Wl,--no-whole-archive
)
```

### Skia Build Dependencies

Skia headers reference `src/` and `modules/` from the source tree. Dawn headers need both source and generated includes. The build script `build-skia-android.sh` handles this, but if you're debugging include paths:

```cmake
target_include_directories(pulp-render PRIVATE
    ${SKIA_SOURCE_DIR}          # for src/ headers
    ${SKIA_SOURCE_DIR}/modules  # for skparagraph etc.
    ${DAWN_SOURCE_DIR}/include
    ${DAWN_BUILD_DIR}/gen/include
)
```

### Oboe Compiler Warnings

NDK 30 Clang is stricter than desktop Clang. Suppress warnings in Oboe with `-w`:

```cmake
if(TARGET oboe)
    target_compile_options(oboe PRIVATE -w)
endif()
```

### Emulator StorageManager Corruption

If you see `NullPointerException` on `StorageManager.getVolumes()`, the emulator's data partition is corrupted. Fix:

```bash
# Kill emulator
adb emu kill
# Restart with data wipe
emulator -avd <avd_name> -wipe-data -no-snapshot
```

### Guard PulpAndroid.cmake with if(ANDROID)

The `include(PulpAndroid.cmake)` in root CMakeLists.txt must be wrapped in `if(ANDROID)` to prevent any side effects on non-Android builds:

```cmake
if(ANDROID)
    include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/cmake/PulpAndroid.cmake)
endif()
```

## Widget Painting Convention

When mapping a 0..1 value to a pixel position with a circular/rect indicator, **always inset by the indicator's radius** so it stays fully within widget bounds:

```cpp
// Convention for slider-like widgets:
float usable = length - 2.0f * radius;
float pos = radius + value * usable;
```

This applies to: Fader thumb, XYPad dot, CorrelationMeter bar, ColorPicker cursors. Knob and Toggle already self-inset by design.

## Widget Animations Without a Render Loop

Many widgets use `ValueAnimation` for visual state changes (Toggle thumb position, Knob hover scale, Fader hover). Without a continuous render loop (AChoreographer), `advance_animations(dt)` is never called, so animations are started but never progress — the widget's visual state appears stuck even though the logical state changed.

**Fix**: Before each paint, advance animations with a large dt to snap to completion:

```cpp
// Recursively advance all widget animations
static void advance_view_animations(view::View* v, float dt) {
    if (auto* k = dynamic_cast<view::Knob*>(v))   k->advance_animations(dt);
    if (auto* f = dynamic_cast<view::Fader*>(v))   f->advance_animations(dt);
    if (auto* t = dynamic_cast<view::Toggle*>(v))  t->advance_animations(dt);
    for (size_t i = 0; i < v->child_count(); ++i)
        advance_view_animations(v->child_at(i), dt);
}

// In render function, before paint:
advance_view_animations(g_root_view.get(), 1.0f);  // 1s snaps to target
```

This is a workaround until AChoreographer provides a proper frame loop with real dt values.

### SkFontMgr Requires a FreeType Scanner (Skia m132+)

Since Skia m132, `SkFontMgr_New_Android` and `SkFontMgr_New_FontConfig` require a non-null `SkFontScanner`. Passing `nullptr` causes SIGSEGV when rasterizing glyphs (not during font manager creation — the crash is deferred to `drawSimpleText`).

```cpp
// WRONG — crashes in drawSimpleText
mgr = SkFontMgr_New_Android(nullptr, nullptr);

// RIGHT — pass a FreeType scanner
#include "include/ports/SkFontScanner_FreeType.h"
mgr = SkFontMgr_New_Android(nullptr, SkFontScanner_Make_FreeType());
```

Do NOT use `SkFontMgr_New_AndroidNDK` for API < 30 — it has locale API bugs on Android 10.

### Safe Area Insets — Status Bar, Nav Bar, Notch

Android surfaces render edge-to-edge. Content must account for system UI (status bar, navigation bar, display cutouts). Pass insets from Kotlin to C++ via JNI:

```kotlin
// Kotlin: read insets and pass to C++ as dp values
ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener(this) { _, insets ->
    val bars = insets.getInsets(WindowInsetsCompat.Type.systemBars())
    nativeSetSafeAreaInsets(
        bars.top / density, bars.bottom / density,
        bars.left / density, bars.right / density
    )
    insets
}
```

```cpp
// C++: apply to root panel padding
g_root_view->flex().padding_top = std::max(12.0f, safe_top + 4.0f);
g_root_view->flex().padding_bottom = std::max(12.0f, safe_bottom + 4.0f);
```

Without this, content renders under the status bar. The `+4.0f` adds breathing room beyond the bare minimum.

### Label Widget Text Not Rendering Under Nested Skia Graphite Clips

`Label::paint()` calls `canvas.fill_text()` which works in isolation, but text doesn't appear when painted through the View hierarchy's nested `save/translate/clip_rect` stack on Skia Graphite + Vulkan. This is likely a Graphite-specific issue.

**Workaround**: Draw section labels directly on the canvas after `paint_all()`:

```cpp
// After paint_all, draw labels at absolute dp coordinates
canvas.set_fill_color(Color::rgba(205, 214, 244));
canvas.set_font("sans-serif", 22);
canvas.fill_text("PULP SYNTH", label_x, pad_top + 22);
```

Use spacer Panels in the flex layout to reserve vertical space for each label.

### Desktop-Only Targets Must Be Guarded on Android

CLI, MCP server, inspector, tests, and examples are desktop-only. Guard them in the root CMakeLists.txt:

```cmake
if(NOT ANDROID)
    add_subdirectory(tools/cli)
    add_subdirectory(tools/mcp)
endif()

if(PULP_BUILD_TESTS AND NOT ANDROID)
    # ...tests...
endif()

if(PULP_BUILD_EXAMPLES AND NOT ANDROID)
    add_subdirectory(examples)
endif()
```

For libraries that conditionally link desktop-only targets (like `pulp-format` → `pulp::inspect`), use `if(NOT ANDROID)` guards rather than `if(TARGET ...)` since the target may not exist yet at configure time due to CMake ordering.

### Dawn API Renames After Rebase

Dawn regularly renames WebGPU types. After rebasing on main, watch for:
- `ShaderModuleWGSLDescriptor` → `ShaderSourceWGSL`
- `choc::value::ValueView` temporaries may not bind to non-const references — use `auto` (not `auto&`)

### No posix_spawn — Also Affects View Code

`posix_spawn` isn't just missing from platform code — view utilities like `ContentSharer` on the Linux `#else` fallback path also hit it. Guard with `#elif defined(__ANDROID__)` stubs:

```cpp
#elif defined(__ANDROID__)
// Android: file sharing done via JNI/Intent — stub for now
void ContentSharer::share_file(const std::filesystem::path&, void*) {}
```

## Oboe Audio Integration

The demo synth uses Oboe with shared atomic parameters for lock-free UI → audio communication:

```cpp
// Shared params — written by UI thread, read by audio callback
struct SynthParams {
    std::atomic<float> osc_pitch{0.5f};
    std::atomic<float> filter_cutoff{0.65f};
    // ...
};

// UI sync (called each frame from render loop)
static void sync_ui_to_synth() {
    auto& p = synth_params();
    p.osc_pitch.store(knob->value(), std::memory_order_relaxed);
}

// Audio callback (Oboe, lock-free)
oboe::DataCallbackResult onAudioReady(...) {
    float pitch = p.osc_pitch.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);
    // ... generate audio ...
}
```

Start audio after the render loop starts, stop in `nativeOnShutdown` (NOT in `android_surface_destroyed`).

### Oboe Stream Mode — Shared, Not Exclusive

**Never use `SharingMode::Exclusive` or `PerformanceMode::LowLatency` on the emulator.** The Ranchu virtual audio HAL can't handle exclusive access — it produces `pcm_writei I/O error` storms that permanently break the audio pipe until emulator restart. Use:

```cpp
builder.setPerformanceMode(oboe::PerformanceMode::None)
    ->setSharingMode(oboe::SharingMode::Shared)
```

On a real device, Exclusive + LowLatency is fine and preferred. Detect emulator vs hardware at runtime if you need both paths.

### Audio Lifecycle — Don't Kill on Surface Transitions

The Activity lifecycle causes surface destroy/recreate during normal transitions (configuration change, initial layout). Three rules:

1. **Don't stop the synth in `android_surface_destroyed()`** — the surface gets destroyed and recreated during Activity transitions. The synth should survive this.
2. **Don't abandon audio focus in `onPause()`** — the Activity gets briefly paused during surface transitions. Move `abandonFocus()` to `onDestroy()`.
3. **Stop the synth only in `nativeOnShutdown()`** — called from `onDestroy()` when the Activity is actually going away.

Violating any of these causes audio to play for 0.4–1.7 seconds then go silent, making it look like an emulator bug when it's actually a lifecycle bug.

### Audio Focus Is Required

Without `AudioFocusRequest`, Android may silently mute the Oboe stream. Request focus in `onResume()`:

```kotlin
audioFocus = PulpAudioFocus(this)
// in onResume:
audioFocus.requestFocus()
// in onDestroy:
audioFocus.abandonFocus()
```

### CLI Audio Debugging

Monitor audio output without speakers using logcat peak levels:

```bash
adb logcat -s Pulp | grep "Audio peak"
# Output: Audio peak: 0.130 (-17.7 dB)
```

This logs every ~3 seconds. If peaks are >0 but you hear nothing, the issue is the emulator audio pipe, not the synth.

## Known Blockers

1. **x86_64 Skia build** — Only arm64 Skia is built. Emulator runs arm64 via translation but an x86_64 build would be faster.
