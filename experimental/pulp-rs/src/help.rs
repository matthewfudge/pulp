//! Usage banner + known-command inventory — shared source of truth.
//!
//! # Why a dedicated module
//!
//! Three call sites need the same command list:
//!
//! - [`crate::cmd::help::run`] — the explicit `pulp-rs help` subcommand.
//! - `main::real_main` — the bare-invocation case (`pulp-rs` with no
//!   args), which in the C++ CLI prints the usage banner and exits 0.
//! - `main::suggest_closest` — the fuzzy-match "Did you mean…?" helper
//!   that runs when `clap` rejects an unknown subcommand.
//!
//! Duplicating the command table between those sites is exactly how
//! drift enters: someone adds a Rust-only subcommand, the suggester
//! forgets about it, and the help banner forgets about it. One
//! inventory, one writer — no drift.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! [`Entry`] mirrors the C++ dispatch tables in `pulp_cli.cpp`:
//!
//! - `commands[]` — native Rust-ported (or to-be-ported) subcommands.
//! - `script_commands[]` — Python-script delegates (Rust does not
//!   re-implement them; the banner just lists them so users can see
//!   they're available on the C++ binary).
//! - `binary_commands[]` — built-binary delegates (same treatment).
//! - Inline/trailing pseudo-commands (`audit`, package/tool commands,
//!   `help`) — parked in a second block to match the C++ banner's
//!   shape.
//!
//! Entries are ordered to match the C++ banner, with Rust-native
//! extensions inserted beside the closest related command. The
//! `help_parity_test` integration test pins that installed surface.
//!
//! # Parity posture
//!
//! The Rust port's banner intentionally mirrors the C++ banner for
//! delegated commands and adds Rust-native commands that have no C++
//! table entry. The user still invokes `pulp` expecting one installed
//! surface; Rust-native vs delegated distinctions should not leak into
//! user-visible output.
