description: Import designs from Figma, Stitch, v0, Pencil, or Claude Design into Pulp web-compat JS with automated visual validation. Claude Design imports also scaffold a pulp::view::EditorBridge handler file (pulp #709). Versioned (parser-version / format-version / compat-schema-version) detection lives behind `--detect-only` and `--report-new-format` (pulp #1031).

# Import Design

Import a design from an external tool (Figma, Stitch, v0, Pencil, Claude Design) into this Pulp project.

Detect which design source the user wants by checking:
1. If a Figma MCP server is available (com.figma.mcp), offer to read the current file/selection
2. If Stitch MCP is available (mcp__stitch__*), offer to list projects and get screens
3. If Pencil MCP is available (mcp__pencil__*), offer to read the current editor state
4. If the user mentions Claude Design or hands over a manually-exported HTML file from Anthropic Labs' Claude Design tool, treat as `--from claude` (no MCP — Anthropic has no public API; per pulp #468, manual file export is the supported path; Spectr's editor.html mapping is the precedent)
5. If the user provides a file path or URL, use that directly
6. If none of the above, ask the user for a source and file

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify source and input

Ask the user or detect from context:
- **Source**: figma, stitch, v0, pencil, or claude
- **Input**: file path, URL, or MCP live data (manual file only for claude)

### Step 2: Read the design data

**Figma (MCP available)**:
- Use `com.figma.mcp` to read the current file or selection
- Extract frames, auto-layout, fills, strokes, effects, text, components

**Stitch (MCP available)**:
- Use `mcp__stitch__list_screens` to show available screens
- Use `mcp__stitch__get_screen` to read the selected screen
- Extract component tree, inline styles, design system tokens

**Pencil (MCP available)**:
- Use `mcp__pencil__get_editor_state` to check current file
- Use `mcp__pencil__batch_get` to read the node tree
- Use `mcp__pencil__get_variables` for design tokens
- Use `mcp__pencil__get_style_guide` for style references

**v0 (URL or TSX file)**:
- If URL provided, fetch the v0 generation
- If TSX file, read directly
- Extract JSX tree, Tailwind classes, shadcn/ui components

**Claude Design (manual HTML export — pulp #468)**:
- Anthropic Labs has no MCP / public API. The user runs Claude Design, exports the canvas as Standalone HTML (or "Send to Local Coding Agent"), and hands you the resulting file.
- Run `pulp import-design --from claude --file <path>` — the parser delegates to the Stitch HTML pipeline and tags the IR as Claude. **This is the static path** — it sees only the loader-shell HTML wrapping the bundled React app (~9 elements: title, bundler placeholders, inline styles, the `<script>` blob).
- Add `--execute-bundle` to invoke the **native-runtime path**: Pulp parses the JSON envelope, decodes the gzip+base64 asset map, evaluates the browser/UMD payloads in a headless `ScriptEngine`, then walks the materialized DOM into the `DesignIR`. Falls back to the static path on any harness failure (engine error, walker output at-or-below the 30-node loader-shell floor, JS payload/runtime errors). Use this when the user's Claude export is a real bundled-React app and they need the actual editor tree, not just the shell.
- The CLI also writes a `bridge_handlers.cpp` scaffold next to the generated JS (override path with `--bridge-output`, skip with `--no-bridge-scaffold`). The scaffold demonstrates registering `pulp::view::EditorBridge` handlers and attaching to a `WebViewPanel` (or future `JsRuntime`).

**Inline `<script>` evaluation in `--execute-bundle` (pulp #758/#1690)**: The harness now evaluates inline `<script type="text/javascript">` (and untyped `<script>`) blocks AFTER the src-loaded payloads, then compiles + evaluates inline `<script type="text/babel">` (and `text/jsx`) blocks via the bundle's own Babel-standalone (looked up as `globalThis.Babel.transform`). After both, the harness dispatches a `readystatechange` → `DOMContentLoaded` → `readystatechange(complete)` → `window.load` sequence and pumps twelve message-loop / frame-callback cycles for async settling. This is what makes a real Spectr-style Claude bundle (where the actual React app lives in inline `text/babel` blocks, not src-loaded payloads) materialize beyond the 30-node shell floor. Per-script soft-fail matches the existing src-loaded payload pattern. Inline `application/json` (and other inert `*/json` / `+json` / `text/json`) blocks are preserved in the temporary DOM so app code can read config data, but are not emitted into the final IR or executed.

**Gotchas that bit pulp #758 implementation:**
- Claude bundles ship browser-targeted UMD payloads. Shadow `exports`, `module`, `define`, and `require` during payload eval so ReactDOM/Babel take the browser branch and install globals on `globalThis`.
- Babel-standalone needs more than QuickJS's default/native 1 MB stack to initialize; the QuickJS backend is intentionally set to an 8 MB JS stack. A stack overflow here usually means the import runtime regressed before inline Babel can run.
- ReactDOM expects a minimal browser DOM surface during commit: `window.location.protocol`, `navigator.userAgent`, `document/window.addEventListener`, `document.activeElement`, `window.HTMLIFrameElement`, and `document.createElementNS` / `setAttributeNS` for SVG-heavy UI. Keep `test/test_web_compat_react_shims.cpp` and the real Spectr fixture test aligned with any changes.
- The static HTML parser and runtime walker must skip executable `<script>`, `<style>`, and `<noscript>` content so source code/CSS never appears as visible labels. Inert JSON scripts are the exception during runtime DOM construction: keep them readable to app code, then drop them before IR emission.
- The harness's `error_out` is the **fallback reason** (or empty on success). Don't piggyback diagnostic warnings on it from inside the harness; on success the harness clears the slot. If you need to surface a warning that survives a successful run, push it through a different channel (e.g. add a `warnings` vector to `ClaudeRuntimeOptions`).
- Empty `<span>` (and other text-mapped tags: `p`, `label`, `h1`-`h6`, `a`, `strong`, `em`, `small`, `code`) get filtered out by the text-empty pruning in `json_to_ir_node`. If a fixture or test relies on observing an empty `<span>` with attributes round-tripping through the IR, use a `<div>` instead — divs map to `frame` and survive the prune.
- Babel-standalone's loaded test: probe `typeof globalThis.Babel.transform === 'function'` rather than `typeof Babel`. Some bundles install `Babel` as a sentinel object before the real implementation arrives, which would false-positive on the looser check.

**@pulp/react bundle dedup (pulp #1292 / #1295, learned 2026-05-03):** when emitting React+@pulp/react consumer bundles (Spectr et al.), the consumer's bundler MUST be able to dedup React across the @pulp/react boundary. This means @pulp/react's published `dist/index.mjs` must externalize `react`, `react-reconciler`, `react-reconciler/constants.js`, and `scheduler` — otherwise esbuild emits TWO independent React module instances (one for user code, one for the reconciler) and `ReactCurrentDispatcher.current` desyncs at first commit, manifesting as "cannot read property 'useState' of null" inside the user's `App()`. The fix is a 1-line addition to `packages/pulp-react/package.json`'s `build` script: `--external:react --external:react-reconciler --external:react-reconciler/constants.js --external:scheduler`. This must hold for any future package emitted from `pulp import-design` that pulls in @pulp/react.

**Spectr's `<svg><path>` doesn't auto-route to `<SvgPath>` (pulp #994 / #1291, learned 2026-05-03):** Pulp v0.69.2+ ships an `<SvgPath>` JSX intrinsic that maps to the C++ `SvgPathWidget` shipped in v0.61.0 (#965/#991). However, plugin bundles emitted from Claude-Design exports (and similar) ship raw `<svg><path/></svg>` markup, not `<SvgPath>`. There's no automatic shim — the dom-adapter (or a future `pulp import-design` post-process) must rewrite `<svg>` → `<SvgPath>` for inline-icon use cases. Track plugin-side adoption when bumping SDK pin past v0.69.2.

**v0.69.0 closes 4 v0.68.0 audit symptoms automatically:** segmented-control vertical stacking (was the most-visible Spectr UX gap) is closed by `display:flex` defaulting to `flex-direction:row` (#1167); FilterBank canvas was already auto-resolved at v0.68.1+; App-root layout-bottom-strip is closed by the same flex-direction default; click-bubble dispatch fully closed in v0.68.0 (#1008/#1073). When auditing a freshly-imported plugin against an older SDK reference, run the WebView↔Native side-by-side at idle FIRST — many "broken" rows resolve via SDK upgrade alone with zero plugin-side work. Pattern documented in `spectr/planning/audit-2026-05-03-webview-vs-native-v0.69.1.md`.

**File-based fallback**:
- Read the file and parse based on --from source type

### Step 3: Translate to Pulp code

Use the appropriate mapping document as your translation reference:
- `planning/figma-to-pulp-mapping.md` for Figma designs
- `planning/stitch-to-pulp-mapping.md` for Stitch screens
- `planning/v0-to-pulp-mapping.md` for v0 generations
- `planning/pencil-to-pulp-mapping.md` for Pencil designs

Generate Pulp web-compat JavaScript:
- Layout: `document.createElement('div')` + `el.style.flexDirection`, etc.
- Typography: `el.style.fontSize`, `el.style.fontWeight`, etc.
- Colors: `el.style.backgroundColor`, `el.style.color`, etc.
- Audio widgets detected by name: knob/dial → `createKnob()`, fader/slider → `createFader()`, meter/level/vu → `createMeter()`, xypad → `createXYPad()`, waveform → `createWaveformView()`, spectrum/analyzer → `createSpectrumView()`
- Design tokens: `theme.colors["name"] = value`, `theme.dimensions["name"] = value`

### Step 4: Write output files

- Write the generated JS to `ui.js` (or user-specified output path)
- Extract design tokens to `tokens.json` in W3C Design Tokens format
- Report: number of elements, number of tokens, any warnings

### Step 5: Offer refinement

After generating, offer to:
- Adjust specific elements ("make the knob smaller")
- Add audio widgets ("add a meter next to the gain knob")
- Change theme tokens ("use darker background colors")
- Preview the UI if a preview tool is available

For interactive review of the current checkout, prefer:

```bash
pulp design
```

If the design tool lives in a nonstandard worktree/build setup, use:

```bash
pulp design --build-dir /path/to/build --script /path/to/design-tool.js
```

When run outside a Pulp checkout, automatic binding currently only works when the `pulp` binary
itself lives inside a Pulp build tree. In generic PATH-installed or split repo/SDK layouts, pass
`--build-dir` and `--script` explicitly.

## Mapping Quick Reference

### Figma → Pulp
| Figma | Pulp |
|-------|------|
| Frame (auto-layout) | `div` with flex |
| Text | `span` |
| Rectangle | `div` with background |
| Component | JS function |
| Fill (solid) | `backgroundColor` |
| Fill (gradient) | `background: linear-gradient(...)` |
| Stroke | `border` |
| Drop shadow | `boxShadow` |
| Corner radius | `borderRadius` |

### Stitch → Pulp
| Stitch | Pulp |
|--------|------|
| Container | `div` with flex |
| Text | `span` |
| Button | `button` |
| Input | `input` |
| Card | Panel |
| Design system colors | `theme.colors` |

### v0 → Pulp
| v0 (Tailwind) | Pulp |
|----------------|------|
| `flex flex-col` | `flexDirection: 'column'` |
| `gap-4` | `gap: '16px'` |
| `bg-slate-900` | `backgroundColor: '#0f172a'` |
| `rounded-lg` | `borderRadius: '8px'` |
| `<Button>` | `createButton()` |
| `<Slider>` | `createFader()` |

### Pencil → Pulp
| Pencil | Pulp |
|--------|------|
| Frame (auto-layout) | `div` with flex |
| Text | `span` |
| Rectangle | `div` with background |
| Variables (COLOR) | `theme.colors` |
| Variables (FLOAT) | `theme.dimensions` |

## Automated Validation Loop

After generating Pulp code, ALWAYS validate by comparing with the source design:

1. **Screenshot the source design** via MCP:
   - Pencil: `get_screenshot(nodeId)`
   - Save to a temp file as the reference

2. **Render the generated JS** headlessly:
   ```bash
   pulp-screenshot --script generated.js --output render.png --width W --height H
   ```

3. **Compare** reference vs render:
   ```bash
   pulp import-design --from X --file input --validate --reference source.png --diff diff.png
   ```

4. **Review the diff image** — red highlights show differences

5. **Iterate if needed** — adjust the generated code and re-render until similarity is acceptable (>85%)

### Yoga Layout Rules (MUST follow)
- Every container needs explicit `height`, `min_height`, or `flex_grow`
- Labels need `min_height` (14px for normal text, 12px for small)
- Faders need `min_width >= 40px` for thumb rendering
- Meters need `min_width >= 20px` for bar visibility
- Knobs need `min_size >= 56px` for arc rendering
- Use `createCol`/`createRow` for containers (NOT `createPanel` which adds glass overlay)
- Row height = max child height; Column height = sum of child heights + gaps

## CLI Alternative

The deterministic import tool is also available:
```bash
pulp import-design --from figma --file design.json
pulp import-design --from stitch --file screen.html
pulp import-design --from v0 --file component.tsx
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html   # writes ui.js + tokens.json + classnames.json + bridge_handlers.cpp (static parser — loader-shell only)
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html --execute-bundle   # runs the bundled React app in QuickJS, walks the materialized DOM (#468)

# With validation
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json --validate --reference source.png --diff diff.png

# Override or skip the bridge scaffold (claude only)
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html --bridge-output editor/handlers.cpp
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html --no-bridge-scaffold

# Override or skip the classnames artifact (claude only — pulp #1035)
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html --classnames editor/classnames.json
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html --no-emit-classnames
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing files.

Detect-only directory inputs (`pulp import-design --detect-only --directory <dir>`) prefer
`code.html`, then `index.html`, then the first sorted `.html` / `.htm` payload. Keep fixture
tests on that deterministic order; raw `std::filesystem::directory_iterator` order differs
between macOS and Linux.

## Bridge Handler Scaffold (Claude Design only)

For `--from claude`, the CLI emits a starter C++ file demonstrating how to wire `pulp::view::EditorBridge` so the imported design's editor JS can `postMessage` into the C++ processor:

- Replace the `MyPluginEditor` placeholder with the editor class that owns the `WebViewPanel`.
- Register one `bridge_.add_handler("type", ...)` per message type your editor emits. Use `EditorBridge::get_float / get_uint / get_string` for safe payload reads, and `EditorBridge::ok_response() / ok_response(extras) / err_response(msg)` for replies.
- Call `bridge_.attach_webview(*panel_)` to route WebView messages through the dispatcher.
- For pulp #468's native-JS-runtime path, swap `attach_webview(...)` for `bridge_.attach_native_runtime(runtime, "<handler_name>")` once the runtime exposes its postMessage primitive.

See `docs/reference/editor-bridge.md` for the full API and the standard envelope-level error vocabulary (`malformed_json`, `unknown_type`, `missing_field`, `wrong_type`, `internal_error`).

## Classnames Artifact (Claude Design only — pulp #1035)

For `--from claude`, the CLI also emits `classnames.json` mapping
`classname → { cssProp(camelCase): cssValue, ... }` for every plain-classname `<style>` rule it finds in the export. Mirrors the output of Spectr's `tools/extract-html-bundle/extract.mjs` so downstream consumers (`@pulp/css-adapt`, `dom-adapter`) can merge class-based styles into inline before forwarding to bridge calls — no separate Node-side extraction script needed.

What the extractor honours:

- Bundler envelopes — when `<script type="__bundler/template">` is present, the extractor walks both the loader shell *and* the unwrapped template HTML's `<style>` blocks.
- Multiple `<style>` blocks cascade: later blocks override earlier ones per-property; unrelated declarations from earlier blocks are preserved.
- Comma-separated selector lists (`.btn-primary, .btn-secondary { ... }`) emit one entry per classname with identical declarations.
- Hyphenated CSS properties are camelCased (`font-family` → `fontFamily`).

What it skips:

- `:root`, `.scheme-*` rules — those are theme-mode token overrides handled upstream as `tokens.json` artifacts.
- Pseudo-classes (`.foo:hover`), attribute selectors (`.foo[data-x]`), descendant combinators (`.foo .bar`, `.foo > .bar`) — anything that isn't a plain `.classname { ... }` rule.
- `@media` / `@keyframes` / other at-rule wrappers.
- `<style>` blocks whose first 200 chars contain `@font-face` (those carry only font-face rules, no classnames).

This skill must stay aligned with the `view-bridge` skill — `view-bridge` covers editor lifecycle (create_view, open/notify_attached/resize/close), this skill covers message dispatch over that lifecycle.

## Versioned Detection (pulp #1031)

`pulp import-design` ships a three-layer version model so the CLI surface stays stable as external tools evolve their export formats:

- **`parser-version`** — Pulp's parser implementation for a given source.
- **`format-version`** — the export shape Pulp recognises.
- **`compat-schema-version`** — the schema of `compat.json` itself.

The matrix is declared in [`compat.json`](../../../compat.json) and consumed by `pulp import-design --detect-only`. See [`docs/reference/imports/index.md`](../../../docs/reference/imports/index.md) for the full vocabulary, recognized matrix, and "add a new format-version" workflow.

### Detect-only flow

When the user hands you an unknown export, run detection first before guessing the source:

```bash
# File or directory; --detect-only prints (source, format-version,
# parser-version, match-count, confidence) and exits.
pulp import-design --detect-only --file <path>
pulp import-design --detect-only --directory <path>
```

Exit codes: `0` = match, `1` = usage error, `2` = no match.

If confidence is below 80%, the CLI emits a warning and an invitation to run `--report-new-format`:

```bash
pulp import-design --file <path> --report-new-format > stitch-2026-XX.json
```

Hand-edit the resulting JSON into a new entry under `compat.json[imports/<source>/detected-formats]`. The `notes` field is mandatory — describe the upstream change in one line.

### Adding a fixture

Every new format-version needs a fixture so the detection gate covers it:

1. `mkdir -p test/fixtures/imports/<source>/<format-version>/`
2. Drop in the smallest representative export that triggers every fingerprint clause (synthetic is fine — clauses are content-addressed, not byte-addressed).
3. Add an `expected.json` sidecar with the assertion shape from existing fixtures (`source`, `format-version`, `parser-version`, `matched-clauses`, `total-clauses`, `min-confidence-pct`, `fingerprint-kinds`).
4. Run `ctest --test-dir build -R pulp-test-cli-import-detect` to confirm the fixture loop picks up the new row.

The detector module lives at `tools/import-design/import_detect.{hpp,cpp}` and is intentionally free of `pulp::view` / `pulp::state` link deps so the test target compiles fast and the unit tests don't drag the full design-import pipeline along.

## Canvas2D Bridge Gotchas (importer + shim authors MUST follow)

When translating browser `<canvas>` + Canvas2D code to Pulp's native bridge (`canvas*` globals), several spec-conforming browser idioms silently break against the bridge contract because the bridge surface is more limited and more direct than the HTML5 spec. The following rules were paid for in production debugging cycles on Spectr's analyzer port (pulp #1346/#1348/#1368/#1372 + Spectr `canvas2d-shim.ts`); the importer must emit code that respects them.

### 1. `ctx.arc()` does NOT add to a path on its own — synthesize as line segments

**Spec:** `ctx.arc()` adds an arc sub-path; subsequent `ctx.fill()` / `ctx.stroke()` operate on it.

**Bridge reality:** `canvasArc(id, x, y, r, sa, ea, fillColor)` strokes immediately and returns. It does not contribute to the active path, so `ctx.beginPath() → ctx.arc() → ctx.fill()` renders a stroked outline ring (just the arc's stroke), not a filled circle. Radial-gradient cap-emission patterns degenerate into hollow ellipse outlines.

**Importer rule:** when emitting `arc()` translation, emit a polyline approximation (~32 segments scaled by radius, 8..64) via `canvasLineTo`. This makes the sub-path closeable and `ctx.fill()` honors any active `fillStyle` / gradient.

```ts
arc(x, y, r, sa, ea, ccw) {
    const segs = Math.max(8, Math.min(64, Math.ceil(r * 1.2)));
    const sweep = ccw ? -((sa - ea + 2*Math.PI) % (2*Math.PI)) : ((ea - sa + 2*Math.PI) % (2*Math.PI));
    for (let i = 0; i <= segs; i++) {
        const a = sa + sweep * (i / segs);
        canvasLineTo(id, x + Math.cos(a) * r, y + Math.sin(a) * r);
    }
}
```

Same applies to `arcTo()` (rounded-rect corners), `ellipse()`, and `roundRect()`.

### 2. Gradient stops are individual `(color, pos)` args — NOT a JSON string

**Spec:** `grad.addColorStop(pos, color)` accumulates stops; the gradient is opaquely passed via `ctx.fillStyle = grad`.

**Bridge reality:** `canvasSetLinearGradient(id, x0, y0, x1, y1, color1, pos1, color2, pos2, ...)` and `canvasSetRadialGradient(id, cx, cy, radius, color1, pos1, ...)` read each pair via positional `args.get<>()`. Passing stops as a single JSON string makes `i+1 < args.numArgs` false on the first iteration → zero stops parsed → bridge dispatch skipped → `fillStyle = grad` falls through to `canvasSetFillColor(id, "[object Object]")` → parseColor returns default white → uniform white fill instead of the rainbow ramp.

**Importer rule:** when serializing gradient stops, spread as variadic args:

```ts
const stopArgs: (string|number)[] = [];
for (const s of grad.stops) stopArgs.push(s.color, s.offset);
canvasSetLinearGradient(id, x0, y0, x1, y1, ...stopArgs);
```

### 3. Radial gradient: bridge takes single circle (cx, cy, R), not two-circle (x0,y0,r0,x1,y1,r1)

**Spec:** `createRadialGradient(x0,y0,r0,x1,y1,r1)` — two circles, with the gradient interpolating in the cone between them.

**Bridge reality:** `canvasSetRadialGradient(id, cx, cy, radius, ...stops)` only takes the single outer circle. Inner-circle / off-axis ring patterns degrade.

**Importer rule:** map JS 6-numeric form to bridge's 3-numeric form using the OUTER circle (`x1, y1, r1`). For Spectr-style center-bloom (`r0=0`, same center) this is visually identical to the spec; for true two-point gradients, file a Pulp issue rather than emitting silently-wrong output.

### 4. `ctx.clearRect()` was a parent-surface eraser pre-#1372

**Reality (pre-pulp v0.74.1):** `ctx.clearRect()` used `SkBlendMode::kClear` / `CGContextClearRect` directly on the parent surface — NOT on a per-canvas backing layer. JS code that clears its own canvas would erase pixels another `<canvas>` sibling had just painted. Symptom: first sibling renders correctly, gets wiped by second sibling's clearRect at the start of its frame.

**Now (pulp v0.74.1+):** each `CanvasWidget::paint` is wrapped in `save_layer`, isolating clearRect / Porter-Duff to that canvas's own buffer. Importer can emit `<canvas>` siblings without worrying about cross-erasure. Pin SDK `>= 0.74.1`.

### 5. Other Canvas2D methods missing from the bridge

- `ctx.measureText()` — bridge has `canvasMeasureText` but the shim should fall back to a per-char approximation (~6.5px for 10px monospace, ~px*0.6 for proportional) when not available
- `ctx.strokeText()` — bridge has no stroke path; fall back to `canvasFillText` and accept the visual gap
- `ctx.createPattern()` — not implemented; emit a solid-color fallback from the pattern's first stop
- `ctx.createConicGradient()` — bridge has no `canvasSetConicGradient` registration even though `SkiaCanvas::set_fill_gradient_conic` exists; either file a Pulp follow-up or fall back to a flat solid

### 6. SDK version requirements for canvas2d parity

| Capability | Min SDK |
|------------|---------|
| `canvasSetLinearGradient` / `canvasSetRadialGradient` | v0.72.4 (pulp #1348) |
| Gradient stops actually applied to fills | v0.72.5 (pulp #1353) |
| `set_blend_mode` on Skia (GPU) honored | already wired; CG/CPU is silent no-op (pulp #1371) |
| Per-canvas `save_layer` isolation (no sibling clearRect erase) | v0.74.1 (pulp #1372) |
| Canvas paint instrumentation (`PULP_LOG_CANVAS_PAINT=1`) | v0.75.0 (pulp #1370) |

Reject importer output that targets earlier SDK versions for canvas-heavy designs — the visual gaps will be silent and look like Pulp bugs.

### 7. Validation discipline

Always pixel-sample after rendering — visual inspection misses uniform-fallback bugs. A spectrum that renders "uniform light gray" instead of "rainbow gradient" looks roughly right at thumbnail scale but is structurally broken (every color stop resolved to white by the parseColor fallback). Sample horizontal cross-sections at the expected gradient axis and assert color variance > some threshold.

### 8. Pointer events need explicit `registerPointer(id)` AND don't bubble

**Spec:** `addEventListener('pointerdown', fn)` plus React synthetic-event bubbling: a click on a child reaches the parent's handler unless `stopPropagation` is called.

**Bridge reality:** Pulp gates pointer dispatch behind an explicit `registerPointer(id)` call (parallel to `registerClick(id)` and `registerHover(id)`). `@pulp/react`'s prop-applier currently only wires `registerHover` for `mouseenter/leave`, so `onPointerDown/Move/Up` listeners are installed in the JS dispatch table but never fired by the native View — the JS handler appears registered (`on(id, 'pointerdown', fn)`) yet clicks never invoke it. Additionally, **pulp dispatches pointer events to the hit-test target only — there is no synthetic-event bubbling.** A handler on a parent `<div>` will not fire when the click lands on a child `<canvas>` that visually overlays it.

This was the root cause of Spectr's "FilterBank renders rainbow but band drag is dead" symptom (spectr #32 / commit `b7ba2b8`). Confirmed by `__spectrLog` probe at the top of `onPointerDown`: handler does NOT fire on `cliclick c:600,400` even though `on(pr_3, pointerdown, ...)` is registered.

**Importer rule:**

1. Whenever the importer emits an `onPointerDown / onPointerMove / onPointerUp / onPointerLeave / onWheel` handler, also emit a `registerPointer(id)` call against the same widget. Do this in the ref-mount callback (or its equivalent post-mount hook) so the bridge wires `on_pointer_event` into the View. Idempotent on the bridge side; safe to call on every remount.
2. **Do not assume bubbling.** If the design has a parent element with a pointer handler and child elements that visually cover it, mirror the same handler onto each direct child too. The handler can use the parent's `getBoundingClientRect()` for coord math so the same function works on every binding.

```ts
// Bind on parent + every interactive child:
<wrap onPointerDown={onPD} onPointerMove={onPM} onPointerUp={onPU}>
  <canvas onPointerDown={onPD} onPointerMove={onPM} onPointerUp={onPU} ... />
  <canvas onPointerDown={onPD} onPointerMove={onPM} onPointerUp={onPU} ... />
</wrap>
```

```ts
// In the ref-mount callback:
const id = inst.id;
if (typeof globalThis.registerPointer === 'function') globalThis.registerPointer(id);
```

The cleaner long-term fix is for `@pulp/react`'s prop-applier to call `registerPointer` automatically when it sees any pointer-event prop (parallel to its existing `registerHover` wiring) — track that as a follow-up Pulp issue rather than an importer-side workaround if you encounter it on a fresh import.
