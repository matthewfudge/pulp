# DSP threading — the audio-thread contract

Pulp's audio thread runs at hard real-time priority. Anything that
blocks it — a lock, an allocation, a system call — causes the
listener to hear a dropout. This page covers the small set of rules
that keep your `Processor::process()` callback safe.

If you're coming from JUCE: the rules are almost identical (and the
gotchas are the same). Pulp's API just makes the safe pattern the
default.

## The three rules

1. **Don't allocate.** No `new`, no `std::vector::push_back`, no
   `std::string` construction. Allocate everything up-front in
   `Processor::prepare()`.
2. **Don't lock.** No `std::mutex::lock()`, no `std::condition_variable`,
   no spinlock with unbounded wait. The atomic accessors on Pulp's
   `state::ParamValue` / `state::StateStore` are lock-free.
3. **Don't block on the main thread.** No `std::cout`, no file I/O,
   no `std::async`, no `dispatch_to_main()`-and-wait. If the audio
   thread sends work to the main thread, it does so via a non-blocking
   queue.

`pulp::runtime::ScopedNoAlloc` (debug builds) tracks rule #1 — Pulp
wraps `View::paint_all` and every adapter's call to
`Processor::process()` in one, so opt-in debug-allocator hooks can
shout when rule #1 is violated. Tooling can read
`pulp::runtime::is_in_no_alloc_scope()` to detect the protected region.

## Read parameters once per block, not per sample

`store.get_value(id)` is a `std::atomic<float>::load(relaxed)`. Cheap,
but not free: repeated atomic loads add inner-loop work and prevent the
compiler from treating the value as an ordinary loop-local scalar.

The right pattern is to **snapshot** the parameters you need at the
top of `process()`, then read from the snapshot inside the per-sample
loop:

```cpp
// Don't: re-read the atomic value per sample.
for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    out[s] = in[s] * store.get_value(kGainId);
}

// Do: snapshot once, read locals.
const float gain = store.get_value(kGainId);
for (int s = 0; s < n; ++s) {
    out[s] = in[s] * gain;
}
```

For multiple parameters, Pulp's `StateStore::snapshot()` returns a
stack-allocated `std::array<float, N>` so you can grab them all in
one go:

```cpp
constexpr std::array<state::ParamID, 3> kIds = {
    kGainId, kMixId, kCutoffId,
};

void MyPlugin::process(audio::BufferView<float>& out,
                       const audio::BufferView<const float>& in,
                       midi::MidiBuffer&, midi::MidiBuffer&,
                       const ProcessContext&) {
    const auto p = state().snapshot(kIds);
    const float gain   = p[0];
    const float mix    = p[1];
    const float cutoff = p[2];

    for (std::size_t ch = 0; ch < out.num_channels(); ++ch) {
        for (std::size_t s = 0; s < out.num_samples(); ++s) {
            // ... per-sample DSP using locals ...
        }
    }
}
```

For modulated reads (the CLAP per-voice modulation path), use
`snapshot_modulated()` — same idea, but each slot is
`base + mod_offset` instead of just `base`.

## How parameter changes reach the UI

Format adapters write host-driven parameter changes via
`store.set_value_rt()` (CLAP / VST3 / AU / LV2). The RT path is
wait-free + alloc-free: it stores the atomic, then pushes a small
`(id, value)` event on a bounded SPSC queue.

The UI thread drains the queue by calling `store.pump_listeners()`
each frame; that's where `ListenerThread::Main` listeners actually
fire. So:

* **Audio thread:** atomic write + lock-free queue push, no `new`,
  no `EventLoop::dispatch` lambda.
* **UI thread:** drain the queue, fan out to listeners.

You don't usually call `pump_listeners()` yourself — `pulp::view`'s
editor tick does it. But it's the right hook if you embed the
StateStore in a non-Pulp host.

## Block-level vs sample-level changes

If you want the parameter change to take effect *within* a block
(automation splits, smooth ramps), use the parameter-event helpers
instead of polling atomics inside the loop:

* `param_events()` exposes the host-delivered `ParameterEventQueue`
  for the current block.
* `format::ParamCursor` advances parameter values at sample offsets and
  interpolates active `ramp_duration_sample_frames` events.
* `format::for_each_subblock()` slices the audio block at parameter
  event boundaries so your DSP can render each stable span.
* `format::ControlRateParamSmoother` follows the parameter's configured
  `smoothing_ramp_seconds` for control-rate smoothing.

## Block-scoped runtime contracts

`pulp::format::ProcessBlock` is the additive runtime contract for
new graph, offline-render, sampler, and generated-audio paths. It does
not replace `Processor::process()` yet. It packages the existing
`ProcessContext` with fixed-capacity `BusBufferSet`, non-owning
`EventBlock`, caller-owned `BlockScratch`, explicit `ProcessMode`,
render speed, and reset/bypass/tail/transport-jump flags.

The contract is deliberately non-owning: bus audio is borrowed from the
host or renderer, event containers are owned by adapters, and scratch
memory is provided before the callback. This keeps the same hard
real-time rule as `Processor::process()`: no hidden allocation, locks,
file I/O, logging, package work, or host calls in the audio callback.

`pulp::format::OfflineRenderHost` is the control-thread companion for
multi-block renders, bounces, freeze-to-sample tests, and generated-audio
materialization. It owns result/staging buffers and may allocate outside the
audio callback, but each processor invocation is still a bounded
`HeadlessHost` block with explicit `ProcessContext`, MIDI, and parameter-event
slices. Use `HeadlessHost` when a test needs one block; use
`OfflineRenderHost` when it needs a fixed-duration render with final-block
handling, silence padding, and absolute-frame event slicing.

`pulp::graph::GraphRuntimeQueues` is the fixed-capacity control/realtime
handoff for graph-runtime work. Control code enqueues graph commands; the
realtime graph drains and sorts them by block offset at the start of a block.
The realtime graph publishes bounded control events and MIDI output events
through separate RT-to-control queues with explicit drop counters. The queue
primitive does not mutate `SignalGraph` directly; graph v2 and adapter
migration code consume these commands against their active snapshot policy.

`pulp::graph::GraphRuntimePlan` is the control-thread topology compiler for
graph v2 work. It turns sparse node IDs into dense node/connection arrays,
precomputes inbound/outbound connection ranges, rejects over-limit graphs,
validates ports, and refuses cycles unless a connection is explicitly marked as
feedback. Build or rebuild plans off the audio thread, then publish immutable
snapshots to realtime code. The old `pulp::host` graph-runtime headers remain
compatibility aliases, but the platform-neutral `pulp::graph` module is the
canonical owner.

`pulp::format::GraphRuntimeSnapshot` and `GraphRuntimeExecutor` are the first
`ProcessBlock`-based graph execution seam. Build immutable snapshots off the
audio thread by binding one process callback per dense graph node, then pass the
active snapshot into each executor call. Do not reset or clear a snapshot while
any realtime call may still reference it. The executor validates the block,
drains graph queues without heap allocation, emits bounded command
accepted/rejected events, and visits nodes in plan order. Snapshot
publication/lifetime policy, audio-buffer routing, feedback delay storage, and
`SignalGraph` mutation belong to later graph-runtime migration slices.

`pulp::format::process_processor_block()` is the additive bridge from
`ProcessBlock` back to the legacy `Processor::process()` ABI. It requires an
active main output bus, allows output-only instrument blocks, publishes
EventBlock sidecars for the duration of the call, restores any previous
Processor sidecar pointers, and preserves the distinction between no EventBlock
and an EventBlock with an empty parameter queue. It does not change the
Processor vtable.

`pulp::audio::rt_safety_contract.hpp` is the machine-checkable sampler/looper
RT-safety label table. It classifies representative public DSP helpers as
audio-callback safe, safe only after `prepare()`, safe only with immutable or
generation-pinned inputs, telemetry-only, control-thread only, background-thread
only, or offline-only. Treat the table as a callback boundary contract: anything
marked audio-callback allowed must not allocate, lock, block, call hosts, do file
I/O, or run package analysis. Import/export, waveform thumbnails, onset/slice
analysis, loop search, publication writes, and materialization stay outside the
audio callback even when their low-level copying helpers are allocation-free.
When adding sampler/looper DSP helpers, add or update a contract row and prefer
conservative `may_allocate`, `may_lock`, and `may_block` flags unless the
implementation and its callees have been audited.

`pulp::audio::SampleZoneMap` is the prepared sampler mapping primitive for
key zones, velocity zones, fixed-pitch triggers, chromatic keytracking,
round-robin groups, slices, and loop metadata. Build or rebuild maps off the
audio thread, then publish immutable snapshots to realtime code. The hot
`ZoneSelector` path is allocation-free and owns no sample storage. Zones may
carry direct `PublishedSampleView` metadata for simple selection paths, or a
stable sample ID for pool-backed instrument runtime paths.

`pulp::audio::SamplePool` is the prepared lookup layer for instruments that
need more than one published sample. It maps stable sample IDs to borrowed
`PublishedSampleStore` views and resolves channel pointers without allocation.
Build the pool off the audio thread, keep the borrowed stores alive while
realtime code can read from it, and publish whole-pool snapshots rather than
mutating an active pool in place.

`pulp::audio::InstrumentRuntime` is currently the RT trigger-resolution join
between `SampleZoneMap` and `SamplePool`: it chooses a pool-backed zone,
resolves the zone's stable sample ID, and computes the playback rate from pitch
policy plus the resolved sample rate. It intentionally does not allocate
voices, enforce choke groups, stream sample tails, apply modulation, or render
audio.

`pulp::audio::InstrumentVoiceAllocator` is the prepared voice-slot policy layer
for trigger allocation, release, deterministic stealing, voice groups, and
choke groups. Call `prepare()` off the audio thread, then trigger/release
against the fixed voice array in realtime code. Note-off moves a voice to
`Released`; the future envelope/render layer should call `finish_voice()` when
the tail is done. Choke and steal are force-termination events and can be
reported through caller-owned spans. The allocator does not own sample data, run
envelopes, apply modulation, or render voices.

`pulp::audio::AhdsrEnvelope` is the per-voice AHDSR/ADSR gain primitive. Call
`prepare()` off the audio thread, then drive `note_on()`, `note_off()`,
`next_sample()`, or `render()` from realtime voice code. `render()` writes gain
values into caller-owned buffers; it does not multiply audio or own voice
storage.

`pulp::audio::SampleVoiceRenderer` is the first scalar sample-reader voice
primitive. It renders one-shot forward playback from a `SamplePoolResolution`
into a caller-owned `BufferView`, using caller-owned source-channel scratch and
an optional per-voice `AhdsrEnvelope`. It can accumulate into an output buffer
or clear/overwrite the requested span. Looping, streaming, interpolation policy,
modulation, and SIMD voice summing remain separate slices.
