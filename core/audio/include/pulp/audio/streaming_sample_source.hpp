/// @file streaming_sample_source.hpp
/// Real-time-safe streaming sample playback primitive.
///
/// Plays a long sample without holding the whole thing resident in RAM, and
/// without ever blocking the audio thread on disk/decoder I/O. The model is a
/// resident *preload window* (the head of the sample, kept in memory for a
/// glitch-free note-on) followed by a *streamed tail* served from a
/// single-producer/single-consumer ring buffer that a background reader thread
/// keeps topped up.
///
/// Short samples (total length <= preload window) take a zero-overhead
/// fully-resident fast path: no ring, no background thread, free looping. This
/// makes the primitive a safe drop-in for samplers that mix long one-shots with
/// short slices — short material behaves exactly like an in-memory player while
/// long material streams. Consumers such as the offline-stretch / tempo sampler
/// and the example PulpSampler can adopt it per-voice (see
/// docs/guides/streaming-sample-source.md).
///
/// Thread model:
///   * prepare()/release()/reset()  — control thread, may allocate, never on
///                                     the audio thread.
///   * pull()                       — audio thread, RT-safe after prepare:
///                                     allocation-free, lock-free, wait-free,
///                                     zero-fills on underrun.
///   * the background reader         — one owned std::thread that calls the
///                                     caller-supplied FrameReader off the audio
///                                     thread. Disable it (start_background_thread
///                                     = false) and drive pump_background()
///                                     manually for deterministic tests.
