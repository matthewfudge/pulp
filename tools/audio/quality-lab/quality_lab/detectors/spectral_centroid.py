"""Spectral-centroid (brightness) deviation (§6 detector).

The stretch skill records that the spectral centroid was the metric that reliably
caught STN noise-morphing *dulling* (~400 centroid points muddier) when peak/RMS
could not. This detector compares the candidate's long-term-average-spectrum centroid
to the reference's and reports the relative shift — negative = duller, positive =
brighter. It is global (no alignment), so it is robust on any material.

Time domain: aligned (a global LTAS over the whole level-matched signal); there is no
per-region localization — brightness change is a whole-render property.
