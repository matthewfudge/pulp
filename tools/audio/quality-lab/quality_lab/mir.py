"""MIR structural oracles (opt-in, license-fenced) — advisory cross-checks, NOT metrics.

This is a *separate* layer from `perceptual.py`. Those tools are full-reference
perceptual **quality** predictors (a MOS/ODG scalar: "is it worse overall?"). aubio is a
feature **extractor** (onset / beat / pitch / MFCC) — it produces structural features,
not a quality score, so it does not belong beside ViSQOL/PEAQ. Its value here is as an
INDEPENDENT second opinion on timing/structure: an external re-implementation that can
expose blind spots in the lab's own (pure-NumPy) onset machinery — e.g. to help graduate
the experimental `onset_drift` detector via non-circular validation.

It is **advisory, never a gate, never a committed baseline** (a GPL/dev-local oracle must
never become required validation evidence). Same license fence as Layer B: reached ONLY
across a process boundary, ONLY via `PULP_AUBIO_BIN`, no bundling/import/auto-download,
and `skipped` when absent (always in public CI).

`PULP_AUBIO_BIN` is expected to be the aubio multi-tool binary; this adapter invokes its
`onset` subcommand (`aubio onset <file>`) on the reference and the candidate and compares
the recovered onset structure. aubio is GPL-3.0 — developer-supplied only.
