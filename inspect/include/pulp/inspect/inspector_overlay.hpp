    //     lock set AND still resolves to a live view. It has been (or
    //     will be) promoted into the authored source, so it survives a
    //     fresh re-import. This is the "reconciled" state.
    //   * drifted — the tweak's anchor resolves to a live view but the
    //     anchor is NOT locked. The edit lives only in the runtime
    //     tweak layer (`pulp-tweaks.json`); a re-import that regenerates
    //     the element would not carry it. "Live-only, not written back."

    //     (orphaned, per TweakStore::DriftReason::anchor_not_found). The
    //     inspector cannot tell where this edit belongs; locking it is
    //     impossible until the anchor is re-established. Conservative
    //     fallback — never crash, never guess.
