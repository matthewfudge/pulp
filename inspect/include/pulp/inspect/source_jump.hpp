// source_jump.hpp — Inspector source-jump: resolve a view's authored
// source location and open it in the user's editor.
//
// Phase 5.1 of the inspector source-jump roadmap
// (planning/2026-05-19-inspector-phase5-source-jump-spike.md).
//
// This is the concrete "jump to source" action. Phase 5.3 already
// shipped the editor-URI *configuration* (pulp/inspect/editor_url.hpp);
// Phase 0b wired a `source_loc` onto `pulp::view::View` from React's
// `__source` prop. This file ties them together:
//
//   1. resolve_source_jump() — given a config + a View's recorded
//      source location, format the editor URL via format_editor_url().
//   2. launch_editor_url() — hand the URL to the OS so the editor
//      actually opens. Kept behind a small seam so headless tests can
//      run the resolve path with `dryRun` and never spawn a process.
//
// The launch shim deliberately lives in inspect/ (dev-tooling), not in
// core/runtime — it is only ever used by the inspector overlay and the
// inspector protocol handler, and is not part of the SDK public API.
