# CSS compat

Status of the CSS property surface exposed by Pulp's DOM-lite consumer
(`core/view/js/web-compat-style-decl.js`). This is the runtime that
implements `el.style.X = "..."` for plugins that author UI as
HTML+CSS rather than React.

The authoritative inventory is `compat.json` (`css/*` prefix). This
page is the human-readable narrative; for the full property list with
mapping notes, supported/unsupported values, and issue links, consult
`compat.json` directly.

## Recently changed

- **2026-05-06 (pulp #1514)** — `css/listStyle` cluster (4 entries)
  flipped `missing` → `partial`. New `View::ListStyleType` enum
  (`none` / `disc` / `circle` / `square` / `decimal`),
  `View::ListStylePosition` enum (`outside` / `inside`), and a
  `list_style_image_` URL slot. Three new bridge fns —
  `setListStyleType`, `setListStyleImage`, `setListStylePosition`.
  The CSS shim parses the `list-style` shorthand into the 3
  longhands (any token order: type / position / image). The
  `@pulp/react` prop-applier exposes the same 4 props with the
  same shorthand parser. The catalog status is `partial`, not
  `supported`, because pulp doesn't model `<li>` / `<ul>` /
  `<ol>` semantics yet — values round-trip to View slots but
  marker glyphs aren't painted today (and `decimal` additionally
  needs sibling-index resolution from the parent's children).
  Marker glyph rendering is the follow-up. css drift -4.
- **2026-05-06 (pulp #1517)** — Background sub-properties wired through
  the JS shim and bridge: `backgroundAttachment` / `backgroundClip` /
  `backgroundOrigin` flipped from `missing` to `noop` / `partial` /
  `noop`. New thin bridge fns `setBackgroundAttachment` /
  `setBackgroundClip` / `setBackgroundOrigin` store the keyword on
  the View. Paint impact today is partial: `backgroundClip: text`
  (paint-time SkBlendMode::kSrcIn against text glyphs) is the only
  variant that needs real paint work and is deferred; box-flavor
  variants are no-ops on solid backgrounds (which is what pulp
  paints), and `backgroundAttachment: scroll` is the conformant
  default for our non-scrolling layout. Wiring is complete so that
  when the paint-side variants land, the slot is already populated.
- **2026-05-06 (pulp #1519)** — CSS outline cluster fully bridge-backed.
  `setOutlineColor` / `setOutlineOffset` / `setOutlineStyle` /
  `setOutlineWidth` now register in `widget_bridge.cpp`; the CSS
  translator at `web-compat-style-decl.js` fans the `outline:
  <width> <style> <color>` shorthand out to the per-attribute
  setters and routes the four longhands through them. View grew
  `outline_color_` / `outline_offset_` / `outline_style_` /
  `outline_width_` slots; Skia paint inflates the box by
  `outline_offset + outline_width / 2` and strokes — outline does
  NOT take Yoga layout space (paints OUTSIDE the border-box, no
  parent reservation). Line-style enum reused from
  `View::BorderStyle` (CSS spec is identical for outline + border).
  Reclassified `css/outline`, `css/outlineColor`, `css/outlineOffset`,
  `css/outlineStyle`, `css/outlineWidth` to `supported`.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 small-wins bundle, Triage #7+#12+#13+#14)** —
  four catalog/translator items combined into one PR.
  * **Triage #7 cursor enum fan-out** — `setCursor` case ladder now
    maps the full CSS keyword set to `View::CursorStyle`. Wired:
    `pointer`, `crosshair`, `text` / `vertical-text`, `grab`,
    `grabbing`, `not-allowed` / `no-drop`, `none` / `hidden`
    (invisible), `col-resize` / `ew-resize` / `e-resize` /
    `w-resize` (horizontal), `row-resize` / `ns-resize` / `n-resize`
    / `s-resize` (vertical), `nwse-resize` / `nw-resize` /
    `se-resize` (top-left diagonal), `nesw-resize` / `ne-resize` /
    `sw-resize` (top-right diagonal), `move` / `all-scroll`
    (multi-directional). Catalog flipped to `partial` — the eight
    CSS values without a `CursorStyle` slot today (`alias`, `copy`,
    `cell`, `zoom-in/out`, `help`, `wait`, `progress`,
    `context-menu`) fall back to `default` and are tracked for a
    follow-up that adds dedicated slots + platform glyphs.
  * **Triage #12 userSelect catalog trim** — `supportedValues`
    trimmed to `none` / `text` / `all` (the actual bridge surface);
    CSS-spec `auto` and `contain` were over-claimed and would
    silently drop. Status flipped `supported` → `partial`.
  * **Triage #13 pointerEvents catalog trim** — `supportedValues`
    trimmed to `auto` / `none` / `box-only` / `box-none` (the
    `View::PointerEvents` enum). The CSS SVG-spec values
    (`visible-painted` / `visible-fill` / `visible-stroke` /
    `painted` / `fill` / `stroke`) are over-claims (pulp doesn't
    render SVG via the renderer surface; SVG is layout-leaf via
    `SvgPath` widgets). Status flipped to `partial`.
  * **Triage #14 flex-wrap reverse modes** — `FlexStyle::flex_wrap`
    converted from `bool` to a tri-state `FlexWrap` enum
    (`no_wrap` / `wrap` / `wrap_reverse`) so Yoga's
    `YGWrapWrapReverse` becomes reachable. Bridge accepts the
    keyword strings (`'wrap'` / `'wrap-reverse'` / `'nowrap'` /
    `'no-wrap'`) and the legacy 0/1 numeric path. The CSS
    `flex-flow` shorthand parser now also recognizes
    `wrap-reverse` and `row-reverse` / `column-reverse`. Status
    flipped to `supported`.
- **2026-05-06 (pulp #1434 Phase A2-2 PR 1)** — CSS Grid surface
  extension. `GridStyle` gains `auto_columns` / `auto_rows`
  (implicit-track sizing for items overflowing the explicit grid),
  `auto_flow` (`row` / `column` / `row dense` / `column dense`),
  `template_areas` (`std::vector<NamedArea>` populated by
  `parse_template_areas("'h h h' 'm c c' 'f f f'")`), and per-child
  `grid_area_name` (resolved against the parent's template-areas
  map). The `setGrid` bridge fn picks up: `auto_columns`,
  `auto_rows`, `auto_flow`, `template_areas`, `grid_area` (named
  token or `row / col / row / col` numeric form). The CSS shim
  cases for `gridAutoColumns` / `gridAutoRows` / `gridAutoFlow` /
  `gridTemplateAreas` / `gridArea` forward verbatim. The
  `@pulp/react` prop-applier exposes `gridTemplateColumns` /
  `gridTemplateRows` / `gridTemplateAreas` / `gridAutoColumns` /
  `gridAutoRows` / `gridAutoFlow` / `gridArea` / `gridColumn` /
  `gridRow` / per-side starts/ends + gap variants. Reclassified
  9 entries to `supported`. PRs 2-3 of the A2-2 ladder wire
  auto-flow dense-packing + named-area resolution into the
  existing `layout_grid` algorithm. css drift -9.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 Triage #10)** — `css/borderStyle` now
  honors the keyword at paint time. New `View::BorderStyle` enum
  (`solid` / `dashed` / `dotted` / `double` / `groove` / `ridge` /
  `inset` / `outset` / `none` / `hidden`) stored on each View; the
  paint pass installs `SkDashPathEffect` via
  `canvas.set_line_dash(...)` for `dashed` (3w/3w on/off) and
  `dotted` (1w/2w on/off) before stroking, and resets the pattern
  afterward so subsequent strokes aren't dashed inadvertently.
  `none` / `hidden` short-circuit the stroke entirely. Other named
  styles (`double` / `groove` / `ridge` / `inset` / `outset`)
  currently degrade to solid — Skia compositions for those are a
  follow-up. CG canvas inherits the canvas-base no-op
  `set_line_dash` so dashed / dotted on the macOS native path
  silently render as solid (Skia path effect not yet plumbed
  through CG). `setBorderStyle` is a newly registered bridge fn;
  the CSS shim's `borderStyle` case forwards the keyword verbatim.
  Reclassified missing → supported.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 sub-agent #12 follow-up)** — three deferred
  CSS surface entries closed in one slice. `css/alignContent` flipped
  NOT-IMPL → PASS: the JS translator (`web-compat-style-decl.js`)
  was already routing `setFlex(id, 'align_content', ...)`, but the
  bridge had no `align_content` case — values silently dropped.
  Bridge now accepts the standard CSS values (`flex-start`,
  `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, `space-between`, `space-around`,
  `space-evenly`) and routes through `FlexStyle::align_content` /
  `align_content_space` to Yoga's `YGNodeStyleSetAlignContent`.
  `css/width` and `css/height` flipped DIVERGE → PASS for the
  `'auto'` keyword (Yoga "hug contents" via
  `YGNodeStyleSetWidthAuto` / `SetHeightAuto`); the CSS translator
  forwards the literal string and the bridge dispatches on
  `FlexStyle::dim_*.unit == auto_`. `first baseline` /
  `last baseline` / `normal` for `alignContent` and `min-content` /
  `max-content` / `fit-content` / `em` / `rem` for width / height
  remain unsupported.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 cross-surface mega-batch)** — per-edge
  `margin{Top,Right,Bottom,Left}` and `padding{Top,Right,Bottom,Left}`
  accept percent values (`'5%'`); margin also accepts `'auto'`
  (Yoga centering — `marginLeft: auto; marginRight: auto`). The CSS
  translator forwards `'NN%'` / `'auto'` strings verbatim; the bridge
  populates `FlexStyle::dim_margin_*` / `dim_padding_*` and routes
  through Yoga's native `YGNodeStyleSetMargin{Percent,Auto}` /
  `YGNodeStyleSetPaddingPercent` APIs. Yoga's padding has no `auto`
  API (margin only). The RN-style shorthand aliases
  (`marginHorizontal`/`marginVertical` /
  `paddingHorizontal`/`paddingVertical`) fan out the same coverage
  to the per-edge dispatchers. `em` / `rem` / `vh` / `vw` / `calc()`
  remain unsupported on lengths (parseCSSLength is px-only).
  Reclassified DIVERGE → PASS for 8 per-edge + 4 alias entries.
  Mirrors PR #1426 (width/height %) and PR #1451
  (top/right/bottom/left %). Net: css drift_count -12, pass +12.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 Triage #8)** — `parseCSSColor`
  (`core/view/js/css-parser.js`) now recognizes the CSS Color Module
  Level 4 modern color spaces: `oklch(L C H [/ A])`,
  `oklab(L a b [/ A])`, `lch(L C H [/ A])`, `lab(L a b [/ A])`, and
  `color(<space> r g b [/ A])` where `<space>` is one of `srgb`,
  `srgb-linear`, `display-p3`. Spike-quality: components are converted
  at parse time to gamma-encoded sRGB hex (`#rrggbb[aa]`) so the
  existing Skia hex pipeline works unchanged. OKLab uses Björn
  Ottosson's published matrices; CIE Lab uses D50→D65 Bradford
  adaptation; display-P3 uses the standard P3→XYZ→linear sRGB matrix
  product. Out-of-gamut values are clamped at the hex boundary.
  Wide-gamut HDR via `SkColor4f` is a deferred follow-up;
  `color-mix()` and `currentColor` are also deferred. Reclassified
  DIVERGE → PASS for `css/backgroundColor`, `css/color`,
  `css/borderColor` (plus seven matching `rn/*Color` entries). Figma
  copy-CSS has been emitting `oklch(...)` since 2024; v0.dev, Tailwind,
  and Claude Design emit `lab()`/`lch()` constantly.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 Triage #9 fan-out)** — `css/transform` now
  supports the full CSS function set:
  `translate(x,y)`, `translateX`, `translateY`, `rotate`, `rotateZ`,
  `scale(n)` / `scale(x,y)`, `scaleX`, `scaleY`, `skewX`, `skewY`,
  `matrix(a,b,c,d,tx,ty)`, plus the full angle-unit set (`deg`, `rad`,
  `turn`, `grad`). The CSS shim's `transform` dispatcher (in
  `web-compat-style-decl.js`) is now a walk-once accumulator that
  merges within-string axes into one consolidated bridge call per
  axis-of-transform: `translateX(10) translateY(20)` produces ONE
  `setTranslate(10, 20)` rather than two clobbering ones. `setSkew`
  is newly registered as a bridge fn (`View::set_skew` had existed
  in C++ since the 2D slot landed; this surface just hadn't been
  wired). `matrix(a,b,c,d,tx,ty)` dispatches via the existing
  `setTransform(id, a, b, c, d, e, f)` bridge fn — preserves the
  full 6-component 2D affine matrix verbatim (per Codex post-merge
  audit P1 — earlier draft decomposed to translate+uniform-scale+
  rotate which silently dropped `c`/`d` skew components on rotation
  matrices like `matrix(0.866, 0.5, -0.5, 0.866, 100, 50)`).
  Deferred (silent no-op): `rotateX` / `rotateY` / `matrix3d` /
  `perspective` — pulp's 2D View has no 3D rotation storage;
  tracked for a follow-up. Reclassified DIVERGE → PASS. Figma
  motion exports + v0.dev hero animations + Tailwind utility
  classes routinely emit the previously-unsupported function set.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 css catalog hygiene)** — eight catalog-only
  refreshes: `css/width` and `css/height` now list `%` in
  `supportedValues` (mirroring `yoga/width` / `yoga/height` post-#1426 —
  the CSS translator forwards `'NN%'` strings verbatim and the bridge
  routes them via `FlexStyle.dim_*` / `YGNodeStyleSet*Percent`).
  `css/backgroundSize`, `css/backgroundPosition`, `css/backgroundRepeat`,
  `css/lineClamp`, `css/webkitLineClamp`, and `css/wordWrap` flipped
  `missing` → `partial` to reflect that the JS translator (in
  `web-compat-style-decl.js`) already routes them; the bridge functions
  remain unregistered so the values silently drop at runtime, but the
  catalog status now matches the harness verdict (DIVERGE). Drift on
  these six entries is cleared. Nine remaining `css/animation*` and
  `css/touchAction` entries closed via #1475's `noop` vocabulary
  extension (see next entry).
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1475)** — Catalog vocabulary extension. The harness
  verifier (`tools/harness/status.py`) now recognizes a fifth catalog
  status value, `noop`, which maps to the harness `NO_OP` outcome.
  Distinct from `missing` (no implementation at all) and `partial`
  (something is implemented but lacks coverage), `noop` says the bridge
  has an explicit registration but the body is intentionally a stub
  pending a future subsystem. Nine css entries flipped to the new
  status: `css/animation`, `css/animationDelay`, `css/animationDirection`,
  `css/animationDuration`, `css/animationFillMode`,
  `css/animationIterationCount`, `css/animationName`,
  `css/animationTimingFunction` (all pending the Phase A2 animations
  subsystem) and `css/touchAction` (pending gesture routing in the
  C++ hit-test path). css drift dropped by 9 entries (60 → 51).
  `css/animationPlayState` stays `missing` because its `mapsTo` is
  `"no branch"` — the bridge has no entry point for it at all, which
  is NOT_IMPL semantics, not NO-OP.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 Triage #11)** — `css/textAlign` now accepts
  `start`, `end`, `auto`, and `justify` alongside the existing `left`,
  `center`, `right`. `start`/`end` map symmetrically to `left`/`right`
  (LTR-only today). `auto` resolves at paint time to `left` (degrades
  gracefully until pulp's RTL slice lands). `justify` reaches canvas
  `TextAlign::justify`; full SkParagraph kJustify rendering is a
  follow-up (backends approximate as left until then). `match-parent`
  remains unsupported. Reclassified DIVERGE → PASS.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 Triage #15)** — `css/boxShadow` status
  flipped `supported` → `partial`. The single-shadow CSS-spec format
  (`[inset] <dx>px <dy>px <blur>px [<spread>px] <color>`) has been
  wired since issue-925 (`web-compat-style-decl.js:565`). Multi-shadow
  comma-separated lists are deferred — single-shadow path covers the
  bulk of Figma / Tailwind / v0 emissions. Drift cleared.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 batch 6)** — `css/top`, `css/right`,
  `css/bottom`, `css/left` now accept percent values (`'50%'`). The
  CSS translator passes `'NN%'` strings verbatim to the bridge; the
  bridge detects the `'%'` suffix and routes through Yoga's native
  `YGNodeStyleSetPositionPercent` via `View::top_unit_` etc. `em`,
  `rem`, `vh`, `vw` remain unsupported (entries stay DIVERGE on those
  units). Mirrors PR #1426 (`width`/`height` percent) for the View
  positional fields.
- **2026-05-05 (pulp #1434 batch 4)** — added `css/marginHorizontal`,
  `css/marginVertical`, `css/paddingHorizontal`, `css/paddingVertical`
  RN-shorthand entries. The DOM-lite el.style adapter now recognizes
  these aliases and fans them out to the matching pair of per-edge
  `setFlex` calls (`margin_left + margin_right`, etc.). Web CSS does
  not define these properties; they ship for cross-tool import-readiness
  so RN snippets pasted into a DOM-lite plugin work as written. css
  total entry count 195 → 199; progress 55.38% → 56.28%.
- `css/border` / `css/borderRadius` / `css/borderColor`: flipped from
  `partial` (clobbered each other) to `supported`. PR #1169 routed each
  through its dedicated per-attribute setter so unset siblings are
  preserved (CSS semantics).
- `css/fontFamily`: flipped to `supported`. PR #1174 splits comma-
  separated lists, strips outer quotes, and picks the first non-empty
  family before calling Skia's `SkFontMgr`. Generic fallbacks
  (`monospace`, `ui-monospace`) still don't resolve specially — Skia
  falls through to the platform default.
- `css/display`: behavior fix in PR #1167. `display: flex` now defaults
  flex-direction to `row` to match CSS web compat (Pulp's underlying
  widgets default to `column`/RN convention). Explicit `flexDirection`
  / `flex-direction` / `flex-flow` with a direction token still wins.
- `css/transition`: extended note — PR #1345 added `:hover` selector
  parsing in inline `<style>` elements, completing the transition story
  end-to-end for the common interactive case.
- `css/__hover_pseudo`: new entry. Documents the bounded `:hover`
  support in `web-compat-document.js`.

## Silent no-ops (parser exists, backend stub)

The JS adapter parses these and calls the bridge function; the bridge
function is **not registered**, so the value is silently dropped.
`typeof` guards prevent runtime errors.

1. `css/animation*` (8 props) — `setAnimation` is registered but the
   body is `(void)id; (void)prop; …` (widget_bridge.cpp:3242). All
   `@keyframes` UIs animate nothing.
2. `css/aspectRatio` — JS routes via `setFlex(id, "aspect_ratio", …)`
   but `setFlex`'s C++ switch has no `aspect_ratio` branch.
3. `css/boxSizing` — `setBoxSizing` referenced, never registered.
4. `css/lineClamp` / `css/webkitLineClamp` — `setLineClamp` referenced,
   never registered. Multi-line truncation impossible.
5. `css/backgroundSize` / `css/backgroundPosition` /
   `css/backgroundRepeat` — three setters referenced, none registered.
   Tied to `backgroundImage: url()` which is also missing.
6. `css/outline` / `css/outlineWidth` / `css/outlineColor` —
   `setOutline` referenced, never registered. Affects accessibility
   focus rings.
7. `css/textShadow` — `setTextShadow` referenced, never registered.
8. `css/wordBreak` / `css/overflowWrap` / `css/wordWrap` —
   `setWordBreak` referenced, never registered.
9. `css/touchAction` — parsed and stored on the JS Element instance
   but never propagated to the C++ hit-test.

## Known buggy-but-supported

1. `css/lineHeight` unitless multiplier (`lineHeight: 1.5`) — silently
   dropped (only `px` accepted by `parseCSSLength`).
2. `css/flexDirection` — `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` silently
   fall through to `col` default.
3. `css/flexWrap` — bool-only; `wrap-reverse` inexpressible.
4. `css/transform` — only `scale`, `rotate`, `translate`, `translateX`,
   `translateY` honored; `scale(x,y)`, `scaleX/Y`, `skewX/Y`,
   `rotateX/Y/Z` silently dropped.
5. `css/overflow: scroll` — silently maps to `hidden` (use ScrollView).
6. `css/position: fixed` / `css/position: sticky` — accepted but layout
   may not differ from `absolute` (verification follow-up open).
7. `css/opacity: 50%` — percentage suffix stripped by `parseFloat`,
   yields `50`, clamped to `1`. Visually fine, semantically wrong.
8. `css/alignItems: baseline` / `css/alignSelf: baseline` — `FlexAlign`
   enum has no baseline variant.
