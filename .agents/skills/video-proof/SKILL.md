description: Record, compose, publish, serve, and review short desktop validation video proofs for Pulp UX/test-harness work. Use when the user asks to "show me it working", record a validation video, prove a click/interaction, share a local proof link, attach a video to a review issue, or compare an implemented UI against source material. Covers macOS desktop capture, Remotion proof composition, attachment budgets, local/Tailscale serving, and review closure.

# Validation video proofs

Use this skill when a screenshot is not enough to prove a UX interaction:
clicking a control, opening an inspector, checking a standalone/plugin host flow,
or showing an implementation next to source material. Default to still captures
for static assertions; record video only when motion, timing, audio/visual state,
or reviewer comprehension matters.

## Rules of engagement

- Work on a feature branch or dedicated worktree until humans have reviewed the
  proof workflow. Do not merge generated videos or local config.
- Treat video proof capture as optional developer tooling, not a core runtime
  dependency and not a normal `pulp add` project package. Prefer the
  `pulp tool install video-proof` add-on for user-facing setup; it owns the
  ffmpeg/Remotion bootstrap and large or license-sensitive dependencies. Keep
  direct source-tree setup (`npm --prefix tools/local-ci install`) as the
  feature-branch iteration fallback.
- Use `pulp tool info video-proof --json` when an agent or setup script needs
  the machine-readable install policy. It should report a machine-scoped
  `tool_addon`, `package_format: not_pulp_add`, and, on this feature branch,
  `artifact_status: source_tree_iteration`. It should also report
  `artifact_pack_command`, `artifact_pack_npm_script`,
  `artifact_verify_command`, and `artifact_manifest_schema` so the
  artifact-review step is discoverable from the registry.
- Use `python3 tools/local-ci/pack_video_proof_tool.py --json` when the branch
  needs a reviewable source add-on artifact. The packer records `sha256`, size,
  included files, npm pins, and policy flags, and it excludes `node_modules`,
  Remotion caches, and generated videos. Follow it with
  `python3 tools/local-ci/pack_video_proof_tool.py --verify <manifest> --json`
  before treating the artifact as reviewable.
- Prefer short clips: 5-12 seconds is the normal range. Keep the recording
  focused on the window or component under test.
- Prefer `video/proof-composed.mp4` for review. Keep `video/proof.mp4` as the
  raw debugging artifact.
- Treat size as a test result. Use `--video-attachment-budget-mb 100` for
  paid/pro GitHub issue attachment planning only when the uploader is eligible
  for videos above 10 MB. Otherwise use a 10 MB budget or publish a local report
  and link the served report instead of attaching the MP4.
- For review issues that may be handled by a non-pro uploader, pass
  `--small-video --small-video-budget-mb 10` to `desktop video`, or rerender
  with `desktop compose-video --small-video --small-video-budget-mb 10`, so
  `video/proof.small.mp4` is available as a convenience attachment.
- Never commit `tools/local-ci/config.json`, `tools/local-ci/node_modules/`,
  `.remotion/`, or generated desktop artifact bundles.

## First-time setup on a Mac

Start by printing the portable setup checklist. Use the machine label when you
are preparing another Mac, such as blackbook:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-setup mac --machine blackbook
```

For a JSON handoff artifact that includes current readiness, add
`--check --run-in-terminal` so the readiness check uses Terminal.app's Screen
Recording grant:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-setup mac --machine blackbook --check --run-in-terminal --json
```

On a fresh checkout, add `--init-config` to create the ignored local config
from `tools/local-ci/config.example.json` before checks run:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-setup mac \
  --machine blackbook \
  --init-config \
  --enable-video-capture \
  --check \
  --json
```

When the goal is to prove the eventual managed add-on install path on a fresh
machine, include `--check-tool-addon`. If `pulp` on `PATH` is stale or points at
a CLI without `tool`, pass `--pulp-command` or set `PULP_CLI`:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-setup mac \
  --machine blackbook \
  --init-config \
  --enable-video-capture \
  --check \
  --check-tool-addon \
  --pulp-command ./build-video-proof-cli/tools/cli/pulp-cpp \
  --run-in-terminal \
  --json
```

With `--check`, inspect `setup_prerequisites` before `check`: missing `pulp`,
`npm`, `node`, or `cmake` means the machine cannot yet run the optional tool
setup path cleanly. Fix those first, then rerun the setup check and move on to
Screen Recording / `video-doctor` failures. `--enable-video-capture` is the
explicit local-config opt-in for recording on the selected target. With
`--check-tool-addon`, inspect `tool_addon` as well; failures there should be
remediated with `pulp tool install video-proof` or the reviewed
artifact-manifest install path before treating the machine as mainline-ready.

When checking another Mac over SSH, add `--probe-host <ssh-host>`. The probe is
read-only and emits `remote_setup_prerequisites` with the remote `pulp`, `npm`,
`node`, and `cmake` status. It uses `zsh -lc` and prepends
`$HOME/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, and `/usr/local/bin`, so trust its
reported `probe` metadata over a raw `ssh host command -v node` check.

If you prefer to create the machine-local config manually:

```bash
cp tools/local-ci/config.example.json tools/local-ci/config.json
```

Install the optional video-proof tool add-on:

```bash
pulp tool install video-proof
pulp tool info video-proof --json
pulp tool doctor video-proof --run
```

The install command installs the repo-local developer ffmpeg and Remotion
tooling and writes a managed wrapper under
`~/.pulp/tools/npm-packages/video-proof/`. The focused doctor command runs the
managed wrapper smoke check. For direct feature-branch iteration, the
equivalent source-tree command is:

```bash
npm --prefix tools/local-ci install
```

To validate the eventual tool install path from a fresh source checkout, build
the Release C++ CLI with examples disabled, then use an isolated `PULP_HOME`:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-video-proof-cli \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPULP_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DPULP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF
cmake --build build-video-proof-cli --target pulp-cli pulp-test-cli-tool-registry -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
./build-video-proof-cli/test/pulp-test-cli-tool-registry '~[slow]'

tmp_home=$(mktemp -d /tmp/pulp-video-proof-tool-home.XXXXXX)
PULP_HOME="$tmp_home" ./build-video-proof-cli/tools/cli/pulp-cpp tool install video-proof --force
PULP_HOME="$tmp_home" ./build-video-proof-cli/tools/cli/pulp-cpp tool doctor video-proof
PULP_HOME="$tmp_home" ./build-video-proof-cli/tools/cli/pulp-cpp tool doctor video-proof --run
rm -rf "$tmp_home"
```

Keep `PULP_ENABLE_GPU` on for this smoke because the C++ CLI target is generated
only in the desktop GPU build graph. Use `-DPULP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF` when the
fresh machine does not have binary Skia installed yet.

Smoke-test Remotion composition without requiring macOS Screen Recording:

```bash
npm --prefix tools/local-ci run smoke-video-proof
```

Pack the source-tree video-proof tool payload for install/distribution review:

```bash
SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=0 python3 tools/local-ci/pack_video_proof_tool.py \
  --output-dir /tmp/pulp-video-proof-tool-pack \
  --version 0.0.0-local \
  --json

python3 tools/local-ci/pack_video_proof_tool.py \
  --verify /tmp/pulp-video-proof-tool-pack/pulp-video-proof-tool-0.0.0-local.manifest.json \
  --json

pulp tool install video-proof \
  --artifact-manifest /tmp/pulp-video-proof-tool-pack/pulp-video-proof-tool-0.0.0-local.manifest.json \
  --force
```

Use `--artifact-manifest` only as the explicit review lane for a verified local
artifact. The default `pulp tool install video-proof` path remains the
source-tree npm install until humans approve a versioned add-on source.

Enable optional video capture for the mac desktop target:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop config set target.mac.video_capture true
```

Prepare the mac desktop target receipt:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop install mac
```

Run the doctor before recording:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-doctor mac
```

Required gates for video:

- `PASS screencapture`
- `PASS video_capture`
- `PASS target.video_capture`
- `PASS remotion_smoke`

`PASS avfoundation_screen` is preferred because it enables the primary
ffmpeg/AVFoundation recorder. If AVFoundation is hidden but `screencapture`
passes, the macOS recorder can still use its screencapture fallback.

Use `--skip-remotion-smoke` for a faster config/tooling check when you do not
need to rerender the synthetic Remotion smoke proof:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-doctor mac --skip-remotion-smoke
```

For a host/plugin recipe, include the recipe details so setup problems are
reported before recording starts:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-doctor mac \
  --recipe reaper-plugin-editor \
  --plugin PulpSynth \
  --plugin-format clap
```

If `avfoundation_screen` fails, ffmpeg cannot enumerate the primary macOS input
`Capture screen 0`; confirm the configured ffmpeg can run from the invoking
terminal and rerun the doctor. This is a warning, not a hard failure, when
`screencapture` passes.

For audio-bearing proofs, validate the explicit AVFoundation audio device before
recording:

```bash
PULP_VIDEO_AUDIO_DEVICE="BlackHole 2ch" \
  python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-doctor mac \
    --run-in-terminal \
    --video-audio system
```

Require `PASS avfoundation_audio`; do not guess a microphone or system input.

### macOS permissions — two are required, and we detect both

macOS gates video proofs behind two separate TCC permissions for the controlling
app (Terminal.app when using `--run-in-terminal`):

| Permission | Needed for | `video-doctor` / `doctor` check | Symptom when missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Screen Recording** | capturing pixels (screencapture + AVFoundation) | `screencapture` check | `could not create image from display`; black/empty captures |
| **Accessibility** | synthetic-cursor (desktop-event) clicks and window raise | `accessibility` check (advisory) | `…requires Accessibility permission…`; clicks refused |

Grant both at **System Settings > Privacy & Security**: add/enable **Terminal.app**
under *Screen Recording* and under *Accessibility*, then **quit and reopen
Terminal** (macOS only applies these to newly launched processes). Pulp app
automation clicks (`--pulp-app-automation`) do not need Accessibility, but they
inject in-app and do not move a visible cursor; real cursor clicks (`--click`,
view-targeted clicks without `--pulp-app-automation`) do need it.

`pulp ci-local desktop doctor mac` and `desktop video-doctor mac` report both
checks, so detect-and-complain is built in — read those before claiming a proof
lane is ready. The interaction path also fails fast with the exact remediation
when Accessibility is missing.

If `screencapture` fails with `could not create image from display`, macOS has
not granted Screen Recording to the terminal or agent app. Ask the user to grant
Screen Recording, restart that app, then rerun the doctor. You can still update
docs/tests while waiting, but do not claim live capture has been validated.

When Terminal.app has Screen Recording permission but the current agent process
does not, run the same command through Terminal:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-doctor mac --run-in-terminal
```

Use `--run-in-terminal` on `desktop video`, `desktop smoke --record-video`,
`desktop click --record-video`, or `desktop inspect --record-video` for the same
permission handoff. The wrapper removes the flag for the child command, relays
stdout/stderr and exit code, and sends a short `caffeinate -u` display-wake
pulse first so idle/remote displays do not produce black captures.

The macOS recorder uses ffmpeg/AVFoundation first and falls back to a
`screencapture -l` frame sequence when ffmpeg capture cannot start. If macOS
refuses window-ID capture but allows full-screen capture, the fallback captures
full-screen frames and crops them to the target window bounds during encoding.
The frame-sequence fallback normalizes encoded video dimensions to even pixel
counts so odd-sized host windows still encode with libx264. Final still
screenshots use a last-resort full-screen fallback for the same TCC edge case.
All paths still require Screen Recording permission for the invoking app.

### Capturing continuous motion vs discrete state (important)

Pick the recorder for what you are proving:

- **Continuous animation** (meters moving, a knob sweep, a spinning 3D scene, any
  per-frame motion) — use `--video-recorder avfoundation`. AVFoundation records
  the live display, so it captures real frame-to-frame motion.
- **Discrete state change** (a click flips a toggle; before/after differs) —
  `--video-recorder frame-sequence` is fine and is the resilient fallback.

Why this matters: `screencapture -l <windowId>` (the frame-sequence path) does
**not** reliably capture live motion from Pulp's GPU/`CAMetalLayer`-backed
windows — it grabs the window-server's composite, which can stay frozen on one
frame for a Metal drawable. It still picks up *discrete* repaints (a click forces
one), which is why click proofs look fine but a "continuously animating" capture
can come out as 96 identical frames (a static screenshot with animated Remotion
overlays). If a motion proof looks frozen, that is the symptom — switch to
`--video-recorder avfoundation`.

Additionally, macOS pauses an **occluded** window's render loop (CVDisplayLink /
Core Animation throttle). Because proofs are driven from a terminal that would
otherwise stay frontmost, the recorder raises the target window to the front and
re-raises it on an interval during frame capture so its render loop keeps
running. A backgrounded target that "stops animating" mid-capture is this
throttle, not a recorder crash.

### Auto-focus on the interacted control (`proof.focus.mp4`)

A change to a small control (a toggle, a knob) is a speck in a full-window
recording — easy to miss, which makes a video look like a static screenshot. So
whenever an interaction has a known click point (the `--click x,y` /
view-targeted desktop-event path), the macOS recorder **automatically produces
`video/proof.focus.mp4`**: the raw recording cropped+scaled to the region around
the clicked control, so the on-screen change fills the frame. It is recorded in
the manifest as `focus` and `artifacts.video_focus`, and published/served like
the other variants. No-interaction smoke runs skip it. This is the "zoom to the
thing being demoed" behavior — use the focus clip when showing a reviewer that a
specific control responded; it is continuous captured frames (you see the change
happen), not a before/after still.

When `--compose-video-proof` is set and a focus clip exists, the Remotion
composer **embeds the focused recording** (via `--video`) instead of the
full-window capture, so `proof-composed.mp4` shows the zoomed change *inside* the
Remotion proof (title card + storyboard + context) rather than a speck. The
full-window `proof.mp4` is still kept as the raw artifact.

Two Remotion render gotchas the template handles — if a composed proof ever
looks like a static screenshot with only the overlays moving, suspect these:

- **Use `<OffthreadVideo>`, never `<Video>`, for the embedded recording.**
  `<Video>` renders a frozen frame under `renderMedia` (only the overlay/zoom
  animation moves), so the recording never actually plays in the output.
- **Start the recording when its panel is visible** (the template wraps it in a
  `<Sequence from={recordingStartFrame}>`). If the clip plays from frame 0 it
  runs behind the title-card intro, so an early on-screen change (a toggle flip
  ~1-2s in) happens while the panel is hidden and the viewer only sees the
  post-change state.
- **Remap the tap marker + zoom-center to the crop frame.** The marker
  (`action_marker.normalized_point`) and zoom (`focus.normalized_center`) are
  computed against the full window. When the embedded video is the focus crop,
  the action recomputes them relative to the crop before writing the source
  manifest — otherwise the marker keeps its full-window position and lands on the
  wrong control (e.g. a knob above the toggle that was clicked).
- **One decision drives both (don't let them drift).** A single `embed_video`
  value in `macos_desktop_action` decides whether the proof embeds the focus
  crop or the full-window capture, AND gates the overlay remap. Full-window
  embed → original full-window coordinates (already correct); focus-crop embed →
  remapped coordinates. Keep the embed choice and the remap keyed off the same
  value so the marker/zoom always match whatever is shown.

Choosing full vs zoomed framing — `--video-focus`:

- `--video-focus auto` (default): an interaction proof zooms the embedded
  recording to the clicked control (the focus clip) so the change is obvious.
- `--video-focus off`: keep the full-window framing (no focus clip; the
  composed proof embeds the whole captured window).

Overlays are placed correctly in **both** modes (the embed decision drives the
overlay coordinate frame), so pick whichever reads better for the proof — zoomed
for a small control changing, full for showing surrounding context/layout.

## Capture a proof

Record a short click proof and render the Remotion composition with the
dedicated video entry point:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --run-in-terminal \
  --command ./build/pulp \
  --click 120,80 \
  --video-note "Clicked the bypass control and verified the meter stayed visible." \
  --duration 8 \
  --video-fps 30 \
  --video-audio none \
  --video-attachment-budget-mb 100
```

Use `--action smoke`, `--action click`, or `--action inspect` to choose the
underlying desktop action. Today, recording is implemented for macOS only;
Linux/Windows video requests fail explicitly until their recorder backends are
wired.

Use repeatable `--video-note` flags for short proof points that should be
visible in the Remotion step list. This is especially useful for host/plugin
proofs where the video shows the host window and logs prove what was loaded.

For a console-style standalone app with no GUI window, record a titled
Terminal.app window instead of waiting for the child process to expose a
capturable window:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --run-in-terminal \
  --action smoke \
  --video-capture-target terminal \
  --command ./build/examples/pulp-tone/PulpTone.app/Contents/MacOS/PulpTone \
  --duration 5
```

Use terminal capture for smoke proofs only. It tees command output into the run
logs, captures the Terminal window, and records the command return code in the
manifest. Use normal app-window capture for clicks, ViewInspector snapshots, and
Pulp app automation.

Use named recipes when the user asks for one of the high-value demos:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --recipe audio-inspector-demo \
  --command ./build-video-nogpu/examples/audio-inspector-demo/pulp-audio-inspector-demo \
  --duration 4 \
  --video-fps 4
```

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --recipe standalone-interaction \
  --source-mode exact-sha \
  --command ./build-desktop-automation/examples/ui-preview/pulp-ui-preview \
  --prepare-command 'cmake -S . -B build-desktop-automation -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPULP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF && cmake --build build-desktop-automation --target pulp-ui-preview -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)' \
  --pulp-app-automation \
  --click 120,80 \
  --duration 8
```

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --recipe reaper-plugin-editor \
  --plugin PulpEffect \
  --plugin-format vst3 \
  --duration 10
```

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --recipe inspector-workflow \
  --source-mode exact-sha \
  --command ./build-video-nogpu/examples/audio-inspector-demo/pulp-audio-inspector-demo \
  --prepare-command 'cmake -S . -B build-video-nogpu -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPULP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF && cmake --build build-video-nogpu --target pulp-audio-inspector-demo -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)' \
  --duration 8
```

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --recipe component-zoom \
  --source-mode exact-sha \
  --command ./build-desktop-automation/examples/ui-preview/pulp-ui-preview \
  --prepare-command 'cmake -S . -B build-desktop-automation -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPULP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF && cmake --build build-desktop-automation --target pulp-ui-preview -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)' \
  --pulp-app-automation \
  --component-id bypass-toggle \
  --duration 8
```

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video mac \
  --recipe design-parity \
  --command ./build/pulp \
  --source-image planning/screenshots/reference.png \
  --source-label "Figma reference" \
  --duration 8
```

The REAPER recipe generates a temporary wrapper command and ReaScript when no
explicit `--command` is supplied. The wrapper launches a fresh REAPER instance,
adds a track, tries common REAPER plugin-name prefixes for the requested format,
opens the matching plugin editor, and records the REAPER window via
`--capture-bundle-id com.cockos.reaper`. The default action is a smoke proof;
use `--click X,Y` for coordinate clicks in the host window. ViewInspector
selectors such as `--click-view-id` are rejected because REAPER is not a Pulp
ViewInspector target. Pass an explicit `--command` to keep a
prepared-session workflow; in that mode, add `--capture-bundle-id
com.cockos.reaper` yourself if the command is only a wrapper process. The
`audio-inspector-demo` recipe is a smoke proof for a built standalone demo
binary; pass the command path for the build directory you want to validate.
Generated REAPER proofs wait for the `TrackFX_Show floating-editor mode=3`
status marker, then refine capture from the main REAPER window to a visible
secondary window that looks like the floating plugin editor. The run manifest
records this as `capture_window_refinement` so reviewers can see the original
host window and the final captured editor window.

For generated CLAP recipes, build and install the plugin bundle before
recording. The recipe checks that
`~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/<Plugin>.clap/Contents/MacOS/<Plugin>` exists and
fails early if the bundle is only a partial package:

```bash
cmake --build build-video-nogpu --target PulpSynth_CLAP -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP"
ln -sfn "$(pwd)/build-video-nogpu/CLAP/PulpSynth.clap" \
  "$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/PulpSynth.clap"
```

If REAPER previously scanned a partial CLAP bundle, its cache can contain a
`[<Plugin>.clap]` stanza without a plugin descriptor such as
`com.pulp.synth=1|PulpSynth (Pulp)`. Generated CLAP recipes fail early in this
state because REAPER will not find the plugin during the proof. Open REAPER's
Preferences > Plug-ins > CLAP and rescan, or remove the stale stanza from
`~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/reaper-clap-macos-aarch64.ini` and relaunch
REAPER.

Run the same checks without recording when preparing another machine:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-doctor mac \
  --recipe reaper-plugin-editor \
  --plugin PulpSynth \
  --plugin-format clap
```

Recipes select Remotion templates and write structured setup context into
`video_proof_composition.context`. The composed video, `index.html`, and
`review.md` display that context, including recipe, host, plugin, format,
component, bundle id, and launch mode when available. `reaper-plugin-editor`
uses the `plugin-host` template, inspector recipes use `inspector-workflow`,
standalone interaction uses `standalone`, component proofs use
`component-zoom`, and source comparisons use `design-parity`.

The `component-zoom` recipe selects the Remotion `component-zoom` template. It
stores `video_proof_composition.focus` from the click selector and resolved
content point, so the composed proof shows a component label, focus rectangle,
and zoom detail inset. Use it when the reviewer should inspect one specific
control instead of hunting through the full app window.

The same recorder can be enabled on lower-level desktop actions:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop click mac \
  --command ./build/pulp \
  --click 120,80 \
  --capture-before \
  --record-video \
  --compose-video-proof \
  --video-duration 8 \
  --video-fps 30 \
  --video-attachment-budget-mb 100
```

Adjust `--command`, `--click`, duration, and fps for the actual scenario. Keep
fps at 30 unless there is a motion-specific reason to go higher.

Keep `--video-audio none` unless the proof genuinely needs audio. Use
`--video-audio system --video-audio-device <index-or-name>` only when a known
macOS AVFoundation audio input or loopback device should be recorded; the same
device can be supplied with `PULP_VIDEO_AUDIO_DEVICE`. Do not guess a
microphone/system device. Audio-requested captures must fail rather than fall
back to a no-audio frame sequence.

For deterministic Pulp-owned plugin or standalone audio, use
`--video-audio plugin --video-audio-file /path/to/rendered-plugin-output.wav`.
The harness copies the WAV into the run bundle as `video/audio.wav`, muxes it
into `video/proof.mp4` as AAC, and then lets Remotion and issue-variant
generation preserve the audio stream. Prefer this over system capture when the
test harness can render the plugin output directly.

For the Audio Inspector demo, prefer the paired HeadlessHost renderer over an
external sine generator:

```bash
cmake --build build-video-nogpu \
  --target pulp-audio-inspector-demo pulp-audio-inspector-demo-render \
  -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
./build-video-nogpu/examples/audio-inspector-demo/pulp-audio-inspector-demo-render \
  --output /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-headless-proof.wav \
  --metadata-json /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-headless-proof.json \
  --duration 4 \
  --frequency 440 \
  --level-db -12
```

Each run bundle should contain:

- `video/proof.mp4`
- `video/audio.wav` when `--video-audio plugin` was used
- `video/proof-composed.mp4` when `--compose-video-proof` is set
- `video/proof.issue.mp4` for GitHub/pro-account attachment review
- `video/proof.small.mp4` when `desktop video --small-video` or
  `desktop compose-video --small-video` is used
- `video/metadata.json` with `size_bytes`, budget, and
  `fits_attachment_budget`
- `video/issue-metadata.json` with copy/transcode/budget status
- `video/small-metadata.json` with the 10 MB fallback status when requested
- screenshots, logs, and `manifest.json`

`proof.issue.mp4` is copied from the review source when it already fits the
configured budget. If the source is too large, the tool runs a bounded H.264
retry ladder: balanced 720p at 24 fps, compact 720p at 15 fps, then compact
540p at 15 fps. `issue-metadata.json` records every attempt and the final
`transcoded`, `exceeds-budget`, or `transcode-failed` status; use the served
report link when the issue variant still does not fit.

Published reports should contain both `review.md` and `review-package.json`.
Use `review.md` as the human GitHub issue body. Use `review-package.json` as the
structured source of truth for automation: it records whether to attach the
primary issue MP4, attach the small fallback, or use the served/local report
link, along with absolute attachment paths, size/budget fields, fallback serve
commands, and source/command/manifest context from the run.

To recompose an existing raw proof:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop compose-video /path/to/run/manifest.json
```

This rerenders `video/proof-composed.mp4`, refreshes composed metadata, creates
or refreshes `video/proof.issue.mp4`, writes issue metadata, and updates the run
manifest.

`video/composed-metadata.json` includes `review_storyboard`: a concise
launch/action/capture/review step list plus source, capture, and issue-variant
context. Published reports and generated issue drafts surface those steps, so a
reviewer can understand the proof before opening the MP4.

To create both the pro-account issue target and a 10 MB fallback:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop compose-video /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --video-attachment-budget-mb 100 \
  --small-video \
  --small-video-budget-mb 10
```

For a design/source comparison proof from two still images, prefer the one-shot
`desktop design-proof` helper. It creates the run manifest, generates the
source/native diff, renders the Remotion `design-parity` proof, and writes the
issue and optional small MP4 variants:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop design-proof \
  --source-image planning/screenshots/reference.png \
  --native-image /tmp/native-render.png \
  --label figma-native-design-proof \
  --source-label "Figma reference" \
  --title "Design parity proof" \
  --note "The source reference was exported from Figma before composition." \
  --context fixture=elysium.pulp.zip \
  --video-attachment-budget-mb 100 \
  --small-video \
  --small-video-budget-mb 10
```

Use the lower-level two-step path when comparing a source image against an
existing recorded run manifest, or when rerendering a proof with a custom diff:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop design-diff \
  --source-image planning/screenshots/reference.png \
  --manifest /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --output planning/screenshots/source-vs-native-diff.png \
  --resized-source-output planning/screenshots/source-resized-to-native.png \
  --json

python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop compose-video /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --template design-parity \
  --source-image planning/screenshots/reference.png \
  --source-label "Figma reference" \
  --diff-image planning/screenshots/source-vs-native-diff.png \
  --diff-label "Source vs native screenshot diff" \
  --title "Design parity proof" \
  --note "The imported layout keeps the same primary control grouping."
```

This renders the source/reference image beside the native proof and, when
provided, adds the diff image to the proof context panel. `desktop design-proof`
and `desktop design-diff` both compare the source/reference image with a native
screenshot, resizing the source image to the native dimensions when needed.
`design-proof` is the repeatable one-shot route for still-image source/native
reviews; `design-diff` writes metadata and copy-paste compose args for an
existing run. Both use Pillow when available and fall back to a stdlib PNG path
for 8-bit RGB/RGBA PNG exports and screenshots. If the run manifest already has
`artifacts.diff_screenshot`, the composer uses it automatically unless
`--diff-image` overrides it. The commands record a `video_proof_composition`
block in the manifest.

## Publish and serve for review

Before recording a batch of examples, print the demo matrix:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop video-matrix --markdown
```

Use it to choose the smallest useful proof scenario. `--target mac` narrows to
the current macOS lane, `--target ios-simulator` narrows to simulator capture,
`--target android-emulator` narrows to Android capture, `--target ubuntu` and
`--target windows` show the planned Linux/Xvfb and Windows/session-agent rows,
`--scenario audio-inspector-demo` selects the fast no-GPU audio-inspector proof,
`--scenario component-zoom` prints one row, `--status ready` filters by status,
and `--json` is suitable for automation. Add `--check` on a fresh machine or
blackbook to include machine-local readiness checks for obvious blockers such
as missing `cmake`, the in-tree audio-inspector demo source, `adb`, `xcrun`,
REAPER, `external/skia-build/libskia.a`, or the design-parity source image at
`planning/screenshots/reference.png`. For design parity, pass
`--design-parity-manifest` to recompose an existing run or
`--design-parity-native-image` to have the matrix emit a one-shot `desktop
design-proof` command from source/native still images. If explicit
design-parity inputs are not provided and that default source image is absent,
the user-facing matrix command searches the configured published report root
for the latest design-parity report with both a copied manifest and a copied
source/reference image. Failed checks include remediation text with the next
setup step. With `--check`,
`--status` filters by computed local readiness instead of declared status, so
`--target mac --status ready --check` is the quick "what can I record here?"
query. The matrix carries
readiness status, Remotion template, doctor command, concrete Release prepare
command, recording/compose command,
publish commands, draft review-issue commands, create-with-map review issue
commands, manifest-map review-watch commands, background serve/status/stop
commands, and reviewer watch-points for standalone, audio-inspector demo,
REAPER/plugin-host, inspector, component-zoom, design-parity, iOS Simulator,
Android Emulator, Linux, and Windows proofs.
Linux/Windows `desktop video-doctor` must fail
`backend.recorder` until their ffmpeg `x11grab` and `ddagrab`/`gdigrab`
backends land.

## iOS Simulator capture

Boot the target simulator first, then check readiness:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py simulator video-doctor
```

Build the PulpSineSynth HostApp, then record a short simulator MP4 with
install/launch context:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-ios-sim-video-proof -G Xcode \
  -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphonesimulator \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
  -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=16.4 \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF \
  -DPULP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
  -DPULP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
cmake --build build-ios-sim-video-proof \
  --target PulpSineSynth_HostApp_Embed \
  --config Release -- -sdk iphonesimulator

python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py simulator video \
  --app build-ios-sim-video-proof/AUv3/Release/PulpSineSynth.app \
  --bundle-id com.pulp.examples.sinesynth.host \
  --open-url https://example.com \
  --action-label "open validation URL after HostApp launch" \
  --label ios-pulpsinesynth-hostapp-proof \
  --duration 6 \
  --video-fps 8 \
  --compose-video-proof \
  --video-title "Pulp iOS HostApp proof" \
  --video-note "Installs and launches the PulpSineSynth iOS HostApp, then records the simulator while simctl opens a validation URL." \
  --small-video
```

This writes `video/proof.mp4` and `manifest.json` under the simulator run
directory using `xcrun simctl io screenshot` frames encoded with ffmpeg. With
`--compose-video-proof`, it immediately renders the `mobile-simulator` Remotion
proof and writes `video/proof-composed.mp4`, `video/proof.issue.mp4`, optional
`video/proof.small.mp4`, composition metadata, and a storyboard into the
simulator run manifest. With `--open-url`, the command opens the URL during
capture and stores a `mobile-simulator` action marker. Coordinate tap driving
still needs a future automation backend because this Xcode's `simctl` does not
expose a tap command.

Use `desktop compose-video --template mobile-simulator` only when rerendering an
existing run with different notes, title, or size budgets.

## Android Emulator capture

Start the emulator or connect a device first, then check readiness:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py android video-doctor
```

Record a short Android MP4 with optional install/launch context and a timed tap:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py android video \
  --apk android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk \
  --package com.pulp.demo \
  --activity .MainActivity \
  --tap 540,1200 \
  --action-label "tap validation control" \
  --label android-emulator-proof \
  --duration 8 \
  --compose-video-proof \
  --video-title "Android emulator tap proof" \
  --video-note "The emulator receives a timed adb input tap during recording." \
  --small-video
```

This writes `video/proof.mp4` and `manifest.json` under the Android run
directory using `adb shell screenrecord`. With `--compose-video-proof`, it
immediately renders the `mobile-emulator` Remotion proof and writes
`video/proof-composed.mp4`, `video/proof.issue.mp4`, optional
`video/proof.small.mp4`, composition metadata, and a storyboard into the Android
run manifest. With `--tap x,y`, the command runs `adb shell input tap` during
capture and stores a `mobile-emulator` action marker. Use `--open-url` instead
when a URL/deep link is the right validation action; do not combine both action
types in one proof.

Use `desktop compose-video --template mobile-emulator` only when rerendering an
existing run with different notes, title, or size budgets.

Publish the latest runs:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop publish mac --limit 3 --label validation-video-proof
```

Publish a specific run or generated demo manifest when discovery is not enough:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop publish \
  --manifest /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --label validation-video-proof
```

Serve a published report on a Tailscale-visible machine. Use background mode
when the link needs to stay alive after the agent response:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop serve /path/to/published-report \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8765 \
  --auto-port \
  --background \
  --label validation-video-proof \
  --json
```

When bound to `0.0.0.0`, `desktop serve` prints candidate watch URLs:
localhost, the machine hostname, any comma-separated `PULP_DESKTOP_SERVE_HOSTS`,
and `tailscale ip -4` results when the Tailscale CLI is installed. If the
reviewer should use a friendly Tailnet DNS name, run with:

```bash
PULP_DESKTOP_SERVE_HOSTS=blackbook.tailnet-name.ts.net \
  python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop serve /path/to/published-report \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8765 \
    --auto-port \
    --background \
    --label validation-video-proof \
    --json
```

Check and stop the background server with the same label:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop serve --status --label validation-video-proof --json
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop serve --stop --label validation-video-proof --json
```

After review, prune old published reports without touching run bundles:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop cleanup --published --older-than-days 14 --keep-last 3 --json
```

Use `--auto-port` for review links so a stale server on `8765` does not produce
a dead URL; the JSON response records the actual port and candidate watch URLs.
If background startup returns `status: failed`, treat the watch link as dead.
Inspect `stderr_tail` for bind errors such as `Address already in use`, then
stop the conflicting labeled server or rerun `desktop serve` with a different
port before sharing the URL.
When background startup succeeds, the command probes the primary URL and writes
`serve_verification` into `index.json` and `review-package.json`. Treat
`serve_verification.status == "ok"` as the local proof that the fallback link
was live before you share it.

`desktop publish` writes `review.md` and `review-package.json` next to
`index.html`, including candidate watch URLs from localhost, configured
`PULP_DESKTOP_SERVE_HOSTS`, and Tailscale when available. Start `desktop serve`
for the report directory to make those URLs live. The review package includes
foreground/background serve commands plus status/stop commands for cleanup.
Generate an offline GitHub
issue draft from that package before opening the issue:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop review-issue /path/to/published-report \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --check-files
```

The command accepts either the report directory or `review-package.json`, then
writes `github-issue.md` and `github-issue.json` next to the report without
calling GitHub. Use `github-issue.md` as the issue body. Use
`github-issue.json` to see which MP4s should be attached and which runs need the
served fallback link. The draft also includes launch command, source branch/SHA,
host/adapter, copied manifest path, and the Remotion `review_storyboard` steps
when composition metadata recorded them. It includes a per-run
`desktop review-status` command so agents can poll for actionable approval or
needs-work feedback before applying the verdict.
`--check-files` verifies that every attachable MP4 still exists and fits its
recorded attachment budget before writing the draft; fallback-link runs require
a recorded `serve_verification.status == "ok"` before the draft is accepted.
GitHub supports `.mp4`, `.mov`, and `.webm` attachments and currently
recommends H.264 for compatibility; paid-plan eligible uploaders can use the
100 MB video budget, while others should assume 10 MB. Attach
`proof.issue.mp4` manually when it fits the chosen budget; attach
`proof.small.mp4` when the normal issue video is too large but the small
fallback fits. Otherwise include the served report URL. The review issue can be
closed when the reviewer comments `looks good to me`. The generated review body
also records the attach/do-not-attach decision, the `desktop review-status`
command for checking actionable review feedback, and the `desktop verdict`
commands for approval or follow-up.

When the user wants the issue created by the agent, add `--create` plus any
labels or assignees:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop review-issue /path/to/published-report \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --check-files \
  --create \
  --manifest-map-output /tmp/pulp-video-review-manifests.json \
  --label video-review \
  --assignee @me
```

This still does not upload MP4 attachments. Use `github-issue.json` to decide
whether to attach `proof.issue.mp4`, attach `proof.small.mp4`, or rely on the
served report link. When the review package has exactly one run manifest,
`--manifest-map-output` writes a JSON map keyed by issue URL, issue number, and
`#number` so `desktop review-watch --manifest-map` can suggest the exact verdict
command later.

Check whether the issue has an actionable approval or needs-work trigger before
recording the final verdict:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop review-status \
  https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 \
  --manifest /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --close-issue
```

`desktop review-status` is read-only. It calls `gh issue view` and detects the
latest actionable comment: `looks good to me` maps to an approved verdict, while
`needs work`, `needs changes`, `needs another pass`, or `not approved` maps to a
needs-work verdict. It prints a suggested `desktop verdict` command when a
manifest is provided. Add `--json` for automation and `--repo owner/repo` when
passing a bare issue number.

At the start of a session, or after posting several review issues, converge with
the read-only watcher:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop review-watch \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --label video-review \
  --state-file /tmp/pulp-video-review-watch.json \
  --manifest-map /tmp/pulp-video-review-manifests.json \
  --close-issue \
  --json
```

The manifest map is optional JSON keyed by issue URL, issue number, or `#number`
with values pointing to run manifests. When a watched issue contains an
actionable approval or needs-work comment, the JSON includes `approved: true` or
`needs_work: true` and, when the manifest is known, the exact
`desktop verdict ... --approved --issue-url ...` or
`desktop verdict ... --needs-work --issue-url ... --comment-issue --notes ...`
command to run. Needs-work suggestions include `--comment-issue` so the
generated same-issue checklist is posted before the local manifest is updated.
Use `--interval` and `--max-iterations` only for short post-ping windows;
otherwise run one-shot and let the state file skip unchanged issues.

Record that review state back into the run manifest:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop verdict /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --approved \
  --issue-url https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
```

If the user asks to close the accepted review issue, add `--close-issue`:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop verdict /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --approved \
  --issue-url https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 \
  --close-issue
```

For another iteration, keep the issue open and capture the reason:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop verdict /path/to/run/manifest.json \
  --needs-work \
  --issue-url https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 \
  --comment-issue \
  --notes "Zoom starts too late; recapture with the component centered."
```

`desktop verdict` writes a manifest `review` block with status, timestamp,
optional reviewer notes, and whether the review issue can be closed. It also
writes `review-verdict.md` and `review-verdict.json` next to the manifest. Use
`--comment-issue` when the generated summary/checklist should be posted to the
GitHub review issue before the local manifest is updated; otherwise use the
markdown as the pasteable issue closeout comment or same-issue follow-up
checklist, and keep the JSON for automation.

## High-value demo scenarios

- Standalone app: launch a built standalone, perform one visible interaction,
  and show the inspector or normal UI state changing.
- Plugin host: run a Pulp plugin in a host such as REAPER, click a meaningful
  control, and show host/plugin state updating.
- Audio Inspector: open the Audio Inspector during a running app and show live
  meters or probe state after a stimulus.
- Component zoom: focus on a specific implemented component and prove the
  interaction or visual state that was just changed.
- Design validation: show source material, the implemented UI, and a small
  comparison/diff frame so a reviewer can understand alignment without knowing
  the feature.

Use Remotion to make these clips reviewer-friendly: title card, scenario label,
run metadata, source identity, launch/action/capture timeline, size/budget
status, and short explanatory captions. Keep the composition factual and
concise; the video should explain the proof, not become a long demo reel.
