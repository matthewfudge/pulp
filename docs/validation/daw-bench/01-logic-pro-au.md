# 01 — Logic Pro (AU v2)

**Target quirks** (from `core/format/include/pulp/format/host_quirks.hpp::HostQuirksMeta`):

- `logic_au_channel_probe_cap` (catalog row #19) — Logic hangs probing >8 channels.
- `logic_au_tail_time_conversion` (catalog row #20) — AU tail time depends on cached sample rate.
- General lifecycle: `prepare` → `process` → `release` ordering.

**Prereqs**: macOS 13+, Logic Pro 10.7+, `PulpHostBench.component` installed
under `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/` as a MIDI-capable AU effect
(`aumf PHBn Pulp`) and re-validated by Logic (Logic Pro → Settings → Audio →
Audio Units Manager → "Reset & Rescan Selection").

Before launching Logic, clear the AU registrar cache and require two stable
`auval` passes:

```bash
python3 tools/scripts/prepare_logic_hostbench_au.py \
    --component build/AU/PulpHostBench.component \
    --identity "Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)" \
    --notarize
```

Use `--dry-run` first to print the copy/sign/notary/staple/preflight commands
without changing files or contacting Apple. If you are debugging an already
installed component manually, run the underlying preflights directly:

```bash
python3 tools/scripts/check_au_component_preflight.py \
    ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/PulpHostBench.component \
    --expect-type aumf \
    --expect-subtype PHBn \
    --expect-manufacturer Pulp \
    --expect-factory PulpHostBenchAUFactory \
    --expect-symbol PulpHostBenchAUFactory \
    --check-permissions \
    --check-codesign \
    --check-gatekeeper
killall -KILL AudioComponentRegistrar 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 5
python3 tools/scripts/check_au_component_preflight.py \
    ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/PulpHostBench.component \
    --expect-type aumf \
    --expect-subtype PHBn \
    --expect-manufacturer Pulp \
    --expect-factory PulpHostBenchAUFactory \
    --expect-symbol PulpHostBenchAUFactory \
    --check-permissions \
    --check-codesign \
    --check-gatekeeper \
    --check-auval-list \
    --run-auval \
    --auval-repeat 2
```

If `auval` cannot discover the component, stop here. Do not use a Logic session
as evidence until AU discovery is stable. If the preflight says `auval -a`
listed Apple components and no non-Apple components, fix the local AU registrar
environment first; that means this Mac is not exposing third-party AU
components to `auval`. If Gatekeeper reports `Adhoc Signed App` or
`Notary Ticket Missing`, verify the shell can use the Developer ID private key
before attempting a new notarized install:

```bash
python3 tools/scripts/check_au_component_preflight.py \
    ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/PulpHostBench.component \
    --expect-type aumf \
    --check-signing-identity "Developer ID Application: <Name> (<TEAMID>)"
```

## Steps

1. **Clear stale logs** in a terminal:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/
   ```

2. **Launch Logic Pro**, create a new empty project (Audio template, 48 kHz, 1 audio track).

3. **Insert PulpHostBench** on track 1 (Audio FX slot → Audio Units → Pulp → PulpHostBench).

4. **Confirm session log appears**:
   ```bash
   ls -lt ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/ | head -3
   # Expect: LogicPro-AU-<timestamp>-pid<NNNN>.log
   ```

5. **Open the log** and confirm the **header**:
   ```bash
   head -5 ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log
   # Look for: session_start  host=LogicPro  format=AU
   # Look for: prepare        sample_rate=48000  max_buffer_size=<N>
   ```
   → confirms Logic detected via `HostType::LogicPro` (catalog row #22 cross-host detection).

6. **Hit Play, let one second go by, hit Stop**.
   ```bash
   grep -E "transport_changed|process_is_playing_edge" ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log
   ```
   → confirms `on_host_transport_changed()` fires and `ProcessContext::is_playing` flips.

7. **Switch the project's sample rate** to 44.1 kHz (File → Project Settings → Audio).
   Hit Play once again.
   ```bash
   grep "process_sample_rate_drift\|prepare" ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log | tail -5
   # Expect either: a NEW prepare event (sample_rate=44100), OR
   #                process_sample_rate_drift entries.
   ```
   → catalog row **#20**: if a fresh `prepare` event arrives, the AU adapter is
     correctly re-cached; if `process_sample_rate_drift` events appear, that's
     evidence the AU adapter is NOT re-preparing on sample-rate change (so
     `logic_au_tail_time_conversion` should stay Speculative pending a fix).

8. **Try inserting PulpHostBench on a multi-output bus** (right-click track →
   Configure Track Header → enable Output → set Output to Surround 5.1 if your
   audio interface supports it, otherwise the largest channel count Logic allows).
   ```bash
   grep "bus_layout_proposal" ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log
   # Look for: inputs=N  outputs=M  where M reflects Logic's probe.
   ```
   → catalog row **#19**: if Logic does NOT probe channels >8 before stalling /
     crashing, that's evidence the existing cap is doing its job.

9. **Save the project**, close it, reopen it.
   ```bash
   grep -E "serialize_plugin_state|deserialize_plugin_state" ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log
   ```
   → confirms state round-trip; `marker_ok=true` on the deserialize line is the
     blob-integrity proof.

10. **Resize the plugin window** (drag the corner).
    ```bash
    grep "view_resized" ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log
    ```
    → confirms `on_view_resized()` fires with the new dimensions.

11. **Quit Logic** (or just delete the plugin from the track).
    ```bash
    tail -5 ~/Library/Logs/PulpHostBench/LogicPro-AU-*.log
    # Expect: release, then session_end.
    ```
