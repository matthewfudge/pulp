# Visual Harness

The visual harness is the golden-file companion to the catalog/property
coverage harness in `tools/harness/`. The catalog harness answers whether an
entry reaches Pulp's bridge. This harness answers whether the resulting layout
or render output is correct under deterministic conditions.

Authoritative design: `planning/phase-b-visual-fidelity-spec.md` when the
private planning submodule is available. The public implementation keeps the
same shape without depending on the planning checkout.

## Phases

- **B.0 determinism setup:** lock Skia, HarfBuzz, ICU, and font inputs; provide
  a stable container/toolchain; prove a tiny SkPicture renders byte-identically
  twice when the locked Skia smoke dependency is installed.
- **B.1 layout snapshots:** run Yoga fixtures through `pulp-test-visual` and
  compare semantic JSON snapshots: DIP rects, z-order, clipping, measured text
  boxes, and hit regions.
- **Later phases:** add Skia PNG goldens for Canvas2D and view paint fixtures.

## Deterministic Inputs

The Day 1 locked stack is recorded in:

- `tools/deps/manifest.json`
- `external/skia-build/VERSION.md`
- `docs/reference/text-shaping.md`
- `tools/harness/visual/pins.py`
- `.github/workflows/visual-harness.yml`

The initial optional Skia smoke uses `skia-python==144.0.post2`, matching the
Skia 144 milestone, because fresh source worktrees can contain only
`external/skia-build` headers and metadata without platform static libraries.
Set `PULP_VISUAL_REQUIRE_SKIA=1` in CI/container environments so the smoke
fails instead of skipping when the locked Skia dependency is missing.

## Interaction And Capture

When a visual fixture needs interaction, prefer Pulp's in-process view hooks
over platform UI automation: `View::simulate_click`, `simulate_drag`, and
`simulate_hover` route through the same hit-test and pointer-event code used by
the hosts. The existing `examples/ui-preview` automation path is the current
reference for before/click/after capture.

For raster capture, prefer `pulp::view::render_to_png` / `render_to_file` for
headless view-tree screenshots, or `WindowHost::capture_png()` when a live
host surface is required. Apple platforms have a built-in screenshot backend;
Linux, Windows, and Android need a host-registered provider via
`set_screenshot_provider()` and should report an explicit skip or failure when
no provider is installed.

## Local Commands

```bash
python3 -m pytest tools/harness/visual/tests/
```

If `skia-python==144.0.post2` is not installed, the SkPicture render smoke
skips with an explicit reason. The pin and font integrity tests still run.

To run the smoke in the stable Linux container once Docker is available:

```bash
tools/harness/visual/docker-build.sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" pulp-visual-harness
```

The wrapper uses `linux/amd64` by default because the pinned smoke archive is
the Skia `linux-x64` release. It also exports/reuses a local buildx cache at
`~/.cache/pulp/visual-harness/buildx` by default, while the Dockerfile keeps
BuildKit cache mounts for apt packages, the downloaded Skia zip, and pip
wheels. Override with `PULP_VISUAL_IMAGE`, `PULP_VISUAL_DOCKER_PLATFORM`, or
`PULP_VISUAL_DOCKER_CACHE` when validating on shared SSH machines.

When macOS rendering is the product risk, run the local pytest smoke on
arm64-darwin as well. The Docker smoke proves the locked dependency recipe and
fresh-worktree behavior; the local lane proves the platform that will own the
canonical raster-golden gate.

The canonical raster-golden gate for future PNG tests is the arm64-darwin
software/raster lane. The Docker image is the reproducible dependency
environment for smoke and developer parity, not a replacement for that lane.
