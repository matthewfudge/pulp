"""Regression tests for the release-pipeline failure modes (#720, #724).

Three distinct failures were silently breaking the release pipeline:

1. **sign-and-release.yml** ran the full ctest suite, which includes
   auval-Pulp* validation tests. On hosted GitHub macOS runners, the
   freshly-installed .component bundle is not picked up by the
   AudioComponentRegistrar consistently, so auval returns "Cannot get
   Component's Name strings / Error -50" and the pipeline fails before
   it ever reaches the sign / notarize / publish steps. The dedicated
   `validate.yml` workflow already owns those validation gates on PRs
   (with the documented codesigning caveat).

2. **release-cli.yml** built the Linux pulp binary with
   PULP_BUILD_WEBVIEW=ON. Because pulp-view is a STATIC library and
   webkit2gtk is PRIVATE-linked into it, CMake propagates the dep to
   the final pulp-cli link line, so the CLI binary ends up dynamically
   linked against libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1.so.0. The smoke runner does
   not have webkit2gtk installed, so the artifact fails immediately
   with "error while loading shared libraries: libjavascriptcoregtk".
   Pulp's documented JS engine policy (CLAUDE.md) is QuickJS on Linux,
   so the CLI must not link JSC-GTK at all.

3. **sign-and-release.yml** had no `permissions:` block, so the job
   inherited a read-only GITHUB_TOKEN. The final `Create GitHub
   Release` step (softprops/action-gh-release@v2 with
   generate_release_notes: true) then failed with "Resource not
   accessible by integration" — the generate-release-notes endpoint
   requires contents:write. Every prior step succeeded, but the
   pipeline still exited non-zero and macOS artifacts never landed on
   the release. Filed as pulp #724 after v0.41.1 exposed the gap (the
   Linux + auval fixes got past the earlier failures, surfacing this
   one).

These tests assert the workflow keeps the load-bearing flags so a
future edit cannot silently re-introduce any of the failure modes.

    already passed the FULL suite on the PR/merge gate (self-hosted lane with
    real GPU/display/iOS-SDK). Re-running ctest on a HEADLESS GitHub-hosted
    runner is redundant AND fails on environment-only tests that pass on real
