# android_smoke.sh — End-to-end smoke for the Pulp Android app (issue #337).
#
# Validates the full bring-up path:
#   1. Build APK via Gradle (./gradlew assembleDebug)
#   2. Install onto a running emulator or device (arm64-v8a expected)
#   3. Launch com.pulp.app/com.pulp.PulpActivity
#   4. Wait for JNI_OnLoad marker
#   5. Wait for Dawn/Skia render-ready marker
#   6. Wait for Oboe/DemoSynth audio-started marker
#   7. Exercise permission flow: revoke RECORD_AUDIO then re-grant, verify
#      native permission-result callback markers
#   8. Exercise lifecycle: am send-trim-memory BACKGROUND,
#      am start to foreground; verify nativeOnBackground / nativeOnForeground
#      markers
#   9. Clean shutdown via `am force-stop` and verify no FATAL exception in
#      logcat between launch and stop
#
# Usage:
#   tools/scripts/android_smoke.sh                       # default: build + smoke

#                                                        # (smoke still validates
#                                                        # audio + lifecycle)
