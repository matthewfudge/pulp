// pulp::events::IapClient — host-overridable in-app purchase seam.
//
// Pulp does not ship a production billing, marketplace, or entitlement
// layer. This API gives hosts a small testable seam they can replace with
// product-specific StoreKit / Microsoft Store / Play Billing code while the
// built-in backend reports `Unavailable` everywhere.
//
// Supported operations:
//   * Product lookup: `request_products(skus, callback)` resolves an SKU list
//     into `Product` records (title / description / localized price).
//   * Purchase: `purchase(sku, callback)` initiates a purchase flow and
//     reports the resulting `Purchase` (state + transaction id + receipt).
//   * Restore: `restore(callback)` re-issues previously-completed purchases
//     so the user can recover entitlements on a new device.
//   * Observer: `set_observer(callback)` registers a single sink that fires
//     whenever the backend resolves a purchase asynchronously (out-of-band
//     transactions, subscription renewals, family-sharing grants).
//
// Not currently implemented by Pulp's built-in backend:
//   * Real StoreKit2 wiring on Apple platforms (sandbox round-trip).
//   * Microsoft Store SDK / StoreContext wiring on Windows.
//   * Google Play Billing on Android.
//   * Server-side receipt validation helpers.
//   * Subscription-specific surfaces (auto-renew status, grace periods,
//     promotional offers).
//
// Built-in behavior:
//   * All platforms default to the stub backend unless a host or test installs
//     another `IapClient` with `install_iap_backend()`.
//   * The stub returns `is_available() == false`, `backend_id() == "none"`,
//     and every operation reports `Unavailable` / empty result.
//   * Production billing stays host-owned so Pulp remains MIT-clean and avoids
//     app-store-specific policy, packaging, and receipt-validation choices.
