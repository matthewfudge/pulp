# Canvas2D compat

Status of the Canvas2D rendering surface exposed by
`core/view/js/web-compat-canvas.js` and the `canvas*` family in
`core/view/src/widget_bridge.cpp`. Backed by the Skia canvas
(`core/canvas/src/skia_canvas.cpp`) on Linux and Windows, and the
Core Graphics canvas (`core/canvas/platform/mac/cg_canvas.mm`) on
macOS.

The authoritative inventory is `compat.json` (`canvas2d/*` prefix).

## Generation

Last refresh: **2026-05-04** against `origin/main` at SHA `a5f4f5ac`.

Spec walk:
[MDN CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
(HTML Living Standard).

This section was previously a stub. The 2026-05-04 pass walked the
~36 prototype methods + 7 attrs in the JS shim against the ~47
`canvas*` register_function entries in widget_bridge.cpp, with extra
notes per backend where Skia and CG diverge.

## Counts (2026-05-04)

`fillText` and `strokeText` flipped `partial → supported` in pulp #1525
once `maxWidth` was plumbed end-to-end and `strokeText` got its own
dedicated bridge command (true outlined-glyph rendering, not the
pre-#1525 fillText-with-stroke-color approximation).

## Recently expanded (#1348)

PR #1348 (pulp #1346, augments #1322) wired up the bulk of the
Canvas2D state-stack and transform surface that FilterBank's
visualizer needs:

- State stack: `save`, `restore`
- Transform: `translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, `setTransform`,
  `resetTransform`, `transform` (pure-translation only)
- Path construction: `arc`, `arcTo`, `bezierCurveTo`,
  `quadraticCurveTo`, `rect`, `roundRect`, `ellipse`, `clip`
- Text: `fillText`, `strokeText`
- Gradients: `createLinearGradient`, `createRadialGradient`,
  `addColorStop`
- Compositing: `globalAlpha`, `globalCompositeOperation`
- Line state: `lineCap`, `lineJoin`, `setLineDash` / `getLineDash`

Skia gradient-shape fills (fillRect / fillCircle /
fillRoundedRect honoring an active linear or radial gradient) landed
in #1353. CG counterpart in #1359 / PR #1360 (merged 2026-05-03).

## Pre-existing surface

These were wired before #1348 and remain stable:
`fillRect`, `strokeRect`, `clearRect`, `beginPath`, `closePath`,
`moveTo`, `lineTo`, `fill`, `stroke`, `lineWidth`, `textAlign`,
`textBaseline`, `fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, `measureText`,
`drawImage`, `getImageData`, `putImageData`. Pulp-specific bridge
conveniences: `canvasFillCircle`, `canvasFillRoundedRect`,
`canvasStrokeLine`.

## Notable gaps

1. **`filter`** — Canvas2D per-context filter chains are not wired.
2. **`direction`** — text rendering direction (ltr/rtl) tracked locally
   but never pushed.

## Recently expanded — full CSS `font` shorthand (pulp #1434)

The Canvas2D `ctx.font` setter previously only parsed the legacy
`'<size>px <family>'` form, so every Figma copy-CSS value of the shape
`'italic small-caps bold 14px/1.4 "Inter", sans-serif'` collapsed to
`14px sans-serif` (size + first family token only). The 2026-05-05
shim parser now walks the full CSS Fonts Module Level 4 grammar:

```
font: [<font-style>] [<font-variant>] [<font-weight>] [<font-stretch>]
      <font-size>[/<line-height>] <font-family>
```

Plumbing:

- `canvasSetFontFull(id, family, size, weight, slant, letterSpacing)` —
  new bridge fn that records a `set_font_full` cmd carrying weight and
  slant. Replays through `Canvas::set_font_full`, which Skia honours via
  `SkFontStyle(weight, kNormal_Width, italic_or_upright)`. CG falls
  through to family + size (the base default).
- `canvasSetFont(id, family, size)` — kept as the legacy fallback for
  hosts that pre-date this PR.

Supported tokens:

- Style: `normal`, `italic`, `oblique` (slant flag).
- Variant: `small-caps` parsed and tracked locally; not yet plumbed to
  Skia/CG (no canvas-API surface for variant).
- Weight: keywords `normal`/`bold`/`bolder`/`lighter`, and 3-digit
  numeric `100`..`900`.
- Stretch keywords: parsed and dropped (no canvas-API surface).
- Size: `<n>px` (mandatory). `pt`/`em`/`rem` accepted by the regex but
  the bridge expects px — non-px tokens silently keep the default 14.
- Line-height: number, length, or `normal`. Per Canvas2D spec, the
  parsed value is ignored — canvas always uses the font's own metrics.
  Tracked on `_parsedLineHeight` for round-tripping.
- Family: comma-separated lists pass through verbatim. Single-family
  strings have surrounding `"`/`'` quotes unwrapped.

The `font` getter still returns the originally-assigned string verbatim,
so the spec round-trip (`ctx.font = 'italic 14px Inter'; ctx.font`)
returns the same string.

## Recently wired (pulp #1434 bridge-thin gap-fill)

The 2026-05-05 bridge-thin gap-fill PR closed four NOT-IMPL entries
that were blocked only on a missing bridge fn — Skia and CG already
exposed the underlying capability:

- **`createConicGradient(startAngle, x, y)`** — Skia routes through
  `SkGradientShader::MakeSweep` (real conic sweep). CG degrades to the
  first-stop colour (no native conic shader).
- **`miterLimit`** — `SkPaint::setStrokeMiter` (Skia) /
  `CGContextSetMiterLimit` (CG). Sticky stroke state. Spec: non-positive
  / non-finite values silently ignored.
- **`imageSmoothingEnabled`** + **`imageSmoothingQuality`** —
  Skia: `SkSamplingOptions` (`kLinear`, `+mipmap`, Mitchell cubic).
  CG: `CGContextSetInterpolationQuality` (`Low` / `Medium` / `High`).
  `enabled = false` collapses to nearest-neighbour for pixel-art.

### Follow-up: `createPattern` (sub-agent #24)

The follow-up bridge-thin slice wired `createPattern` — deferred from
the original #1480 PR because pattern handling needs an image-resource
identifier shape, not just a bridge fn. Now PASS / partial:

- **`createPattern(image, repetition)`** — Skia routes through
  `SkShader::MakeImage` with `SkTileMode::kRepeat` / `SkTileMode::kDecal`
  per axis. All four spec repetition values are supported:
  `"repeat"`, `"repeat-x"`, `"repeat-y"`, `"no-repeat"`. CG degrades to
  the active fill colour (no first-class CG pattern shader without a
  CGPattern callback dance).

Side effect: the same PR plumbed `setStrokeCap` and `setStrokeJoin`
through `SkPaint` — `line_cap_` and `line_join_` were stored on the
Skia canvas but never applied to the actual paint. `lineCap` and
`lineJoin` are now visually faithful on the GPU path.

The Canvas2D `shadowColor` / `shadowBlur` / `shadowOffsetX` /
`shadowOffsetY` quartet landed in pulp #1434 batch 7 (separate slice).

## Recently changed — `fillText` / `strokeText` maxWidth + true stroked glyphs (pulp #1525)

The Canvas2D `ctx.fillText(text, x, y, maxWidth)` and
`ctx.strokeText(text, x, y, maxWidth)` calls previously discarded
`maxWidth` (the JS shim's `void maxWidth;` pre-#1525) and
`strokeText` re-routed through `fillText` with the strokeStyle as the
fill colour — visually approximate but spec-incompatible.

The 2026-05-06 PR plumbs both calls end-to-end:

- **`fillText`** — `maxWidth` threads through to the bridge as the 7th
  arg (`<= 0` / NaN / Infinity / null collapse to the no-constraint
  sentinel). When the natural advance exceeds `maxWidth`, the backend
  scales the run horizontally to exactly `maxWidth` px:
  - Skia: `SkMatrix::Scale(maxWidth/measured, 1.0)` around the text
    origin (vertical metrics unchanged).
  - CG: `CGContextScaleCTM(maxWidth/measured, 1.0)` around the origin.
  - Glyph clusters are preserved by construction — HarfBuzz (Skia path)
    and CoreText (CG path) shape each cluster as a rigid unit, so
    horizontal scaling never breaks a ligature or combining sequence.
- **`strokeText`** — dedicated `canvasStrokeText` bridge fn records a
  `stroke_text` cmd; the paint loop dispatches to `Canvas::stroke_text`:
  - Skia: `SkPaint::kStroke_Style` paint at the active `lineWidth` /
    `strokeStyle`.
  - CG: `CGContextSetTextDrawingMode(kCGTextStroke)` + active
    `CGContextSetRGBStrokeColor`.
  - The shim falls back to the pre-#1525 fillText-with-strokeStyle
    approximation on legacy hosts (no `canvasStrokeText` registered),
    so a v0.78 plugin still renders visible text on a v0.77 host.
- **`measureText`** — unchanged. Reports the natural advance regardless
  of any subsequent `fillText` `maxWidth` squeeze.

## Partial / approximated

1. **`arcTo`** — currently emits `lineTo(x1,y1) + lineTo(x2,y2)`,
   ignoring the radius. Used by `roundRect` and FilterBank's marquee
   corners; fidelity loss is minimal for those use cases.
2. **`ellipse`** — ignores `rotation`; falls through to `arc` when
   `rx === ry`; otherwise emits a 4-segment cubic approximation.
3. **`transform`** (concat-on-right) — bridge only exposes `setTransform`
   (replace). Pure-translation matrices fall through to `translate`;
   anything else is a no-op.
4. **`createRadialGradient`** — bridge models a single-circle radial
   gradient; shim uses the outer circle. Visually equivalent for
   centre-bloom usage where `x0 === x1`, `y0 === y1`, `r0 === 0`.
5. **`drawImage`** 9-arg form — sprite-sheet slicing
   (`sx, sy, sw, sh`) is currently ignored.
6. **`putImageData`** sub-rect form — `dirtyX/Y/W/H` ignored.
7. **`setLineDash`** — odd-length spec-doubling is bridge-side; shim
   passes verbatim. `lineDashOffset` mutation between draws is not
   re-pushed (must re-call `setLineDash`).
8. **`strokeStyle = gradient`** — bridge has no stroke-gradient setter;
   degrades to the first stop's color.

## WebGPU surface

`canvas.getContext('webgpu')` is wired through
`__createGPUCanvasContext` — bridges to native WebGPU when the device
is native. See planning notes for the Three.js + Dawn end-to-end story.
The full WebGPU surface lives separately in `web-compat-gpu-buffered.js`
and is out of scope for this Canvas2D compat doc.
