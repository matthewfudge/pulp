/// Phase 4a — Lock-to-source, Path A (generated-TSX/JS rewrite).
///
/// Spec: planning/2026-05-18-inspector-direct-manipulation-roadmap.md,
///       "Phase 4 — Lock-to-source" / "Phase 4a — Path A".
///
/// The inspector's direct-manipulation edits land in a tweaks layer
/// (`pulp-tweaks.json`, keyed by `stable_anchor_id`). "Lock to source" is
/// the explicit, opt-in promotion of a tweak back into the *authored*
/// source so the change is permanent and survives a fresh re-import.
///
/// Path A handles the **generated** import target: when `pulp
/// import-design` lowered a design into web-compat JS/TSX, that text is
/// owned by the user and carries machine-traceable provenance:
///
///   * a `// @pulp-anchor <id>` trail comment before every element
///     (emitted by `generate_pulp_js` when `include_comments` is on), and
///   * a `setAnchor(<var>._id, '<id>')` call binding the live widget.
///
/// Locking a tweak means: locate the element block for `anchor_id`, then
/// rewrite (or insert) the `el.style.<prop>` assignment that corresponds
/// to the tweak's dotted `property_path` so the generated file now
/// reflects the tweaked value. After a successful lock the tweak-store
/// entry can be retired — the value is baked into the source.
///
/// Scope discipline (per the roadmap): this is **Path A only**. Path B
/// (live-runtime React-bundle AST patch, #1308) and Path C (DESIGN.md
/// token export) are separate phases and are NOT implemented here.
///
/// The engine is pure text in / text out — no filesystem I/O — so it is
/// trivially unit-testable and the CLI / inspector layers own the
/// read-confirm-write loop and the `@generated`-boundary guard.

// ── WYSIWYG T5 — structural reparent lock-to-source ──────────────────────────
//
// A reflow-aware drag can "drop element A inside container B" — a STRUCTURAL
// tree edit, not a style tweak. In the generated web-compat artifact every
// element block ends with `<parentVar>.appendChild(<var>);` wiring it to its
// parent. Reparenting therefore means rewriting the dragged element's
// `appendChild` receiver from its old parent's var to the NEW parent's var.
//
// This is the structural sibling of lock_tweak_into_source(): it is a pure
// text-in/text-out rewrite over the same anchor-comment block model. It does
// NOT (yet) move the element block's TEXT to sit physically inside the new
// parent's block — the appendChild receiver rewrite is what changes the live
// DOM parent, and re-running the element block in source order still produces
// the reparented tree because createElement + appendChild are order-independent
// once the receiver is correct. Reordering the physical block position to match
// is a follow-up (see the T5 notes in the import-design SKILL).

/// A single structural reparent to promote into source: move the element
/// anchored by `child_anchor_id` to become a child of the element anchored by
/// `new_parent_anchor_id`.
///
/// WYSIWYG sweep P1 — `insert_after_anchor_id` carries the requested insertion
/// SLOT: the anchor of the sibling the moved block should physically follow
/// under the new parent, or EMPTY to land as the new parent's FIRST child.
/// Without it the relocation always dropped the block as the first child,
/// discarding the drop position. An empty / unresolved value falls back to
/// first-child (the prior behavior), so callers that don't set it are
/// unaffected.

/// rewrites the receiver to that var. Status semantics mirror
/// lock_tweak_into_source: `rewritten` on success, `already_current` when the

/// anchor (or the appendChild line, or the parent's var) cannot be located.
/// `anchor_not_found` is ALSO returned — with the source left byte-identical —
/// when the new parent's anchor lies inside the moved child's subtree (a cyclic
/// reparent) or the subtree span cannot be resolved: rewriting the receiver
/// alone would emit `<descendant>.appendChild(<ancestor>);`, so the engine
