"""Single-source-of-truth check for the Shipyard pin (D1).

`tools/shipyard.toml` is the canonical pin used by
`tools/install-shipyard.sh` and `shipyard pr`. Two release workflows
(`.github/workflows/release-cli.yml` and `.github/workflows/post-tag-sync.yml`)
also bake the version into a `SHIPYARD_VERSION` env value. Prior drift
between those locations broke release-note generation (Codex P1 on
PR #719), and the fix at the time was "remember to update both".

This script makes the drift mechanically impossible to ship by
validating that every workflow's `SHIPYARD_VERSION` matches the pin in
`tools/shipyard.toml`. Wire it into a workflow lint test or run it
locally before pushing release-pipeline changes.

Exits:
    0 — every required workflow declares a matching `SHIPYARD_VERSION`.
    1 — drift detected (mismatch OR a required workflow stopped
        declaring `SHIPYARD_VERSION` entirely — vacuous-pass case).
    2 — configuration error (file missing, unparseable, etc).

The vacuous-pass case is gated by `REQUIRED_PIN_WORKFLOWS` — the
explicit set of workflow filenames that MUST carry the pin. Codex P1
on PR #2131 flagged that a silent removal of the env entry would
otherwise let the script exit 0 even though the pin was no longer
enforced anywhere. If a future refactor removes the pin from one of
those workflows (e.g. replaces the inline env with a step that reads
`tools/shipyard.toml` at runtime), update `REQUIRED_PIN_WORKFLOWS`
in the same diff with a comment explaining why.
