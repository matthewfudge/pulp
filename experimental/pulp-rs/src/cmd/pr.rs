//! `pulp-rs pr` — delegate to `shipyard pr`.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Phase 6 ports only the *happy path* of the C++ shim: locate
//! `shipyard` on `$PATH`, spawn it with forwarded args, return the
//! child's exit code. The native fallback implementation in
//! `cmd_pr.cpp` (git porcelain + skill-sync + version-bump + gh pr
//! create + shipyard ship) is deliberately NOT ported — it exists on
//! the C++ side purely as a debug escape hatch for when `shipyard`
//! itself is broken, and porting five separate subprocess flows
//! would balloon this file past 500 LOC for near-zero user value.
//! If a user hits `pulp pr --native` on the Rust binary we print a
//! clear "not ported — use the C++ binary" message and exit 2.
//!
//! # `shipyard` version-pin enforcement
//!
//! The C++ shim also reads `tools/shipyard.toml`, runs `shipyard
//! --version`, and exits 2 on mismatch. We preserve that guard here
//! because shipping a Rust binary that silently accepted a stale
//! shipyard would regress the protection that went in with #152.
//! The pin reader mirrors [`crate::config::pulp_home`]'s style: read
//! the file, grep for `version = "vX.Y.Z"`, return the bare string.
//!
//! # Env override
//!
//! `PULP_PR_SKIP_VERSION_GUARD=1` bypasses the pin check, same as the
//! C++ shim. Useful for CI that intentionally tests against a newer
//! shipyard on a branch.
