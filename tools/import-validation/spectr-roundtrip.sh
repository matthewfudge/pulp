# spectr-roundtrip.sh — re-import editor.html via pulp, rebuild Spectr native
# bridge, launch, capture, diff against REFERENCE. The full A→D loop in one
# command, so we can re-run after every Pulp importer fix and instantly see
# whether the gap narrowed.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/import-validation/spectr-roundtrip.sh
#   tools/import-validation/spectr-roundtrip.sh --skip-import   # use existing bundle
#   tools/import-validation/spectr-roundtrip.sh --skip-build    # use existing build
#   tools/import-validation/spectr-roundtrip.sh --skip-capture  # use existing screenshot
#
# Env:
#   PULP_HARNESS_THRESHOLD  similarity threshold for PASS (default 0.85)
#   PULP_DIR               override pulp checkout path (default /Users/danielraffel/Code/pulp)
#   SPECTR_DIR             override spectr checkout path (default /Users/danielraffel/Code/spectr)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  PASS  — Spectr native render matches reference within tolerance
#   1  FAIL  — render diverges (the gap; what we're working to close)
#   2  ERROR — pipeline broke (build fail, crash, missing tool)
