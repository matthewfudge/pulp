/// @file audio_probe.hpp
/// Realtime-safe audio output probe (the RT *producer* in the harness plan's
/// two-layer split). `AudioProbe::analyze_output()` is callable from the audio
/// callback and satisfies a strict RT ABI: no allocation, no std::vector
/// growth, no locks, no file I/O, no logging, no exceptions, no UI/host/package
/// callbacks, and NO FFT/STFT. It performs only bounded per-block scalar work
/// (peak, RMS accumulate, clip count, NaN/Inf count, silence-run) and publishes
/// the latest summary through a `runtime::TripleBuffer<AudioProbeSnapshot>`.
///
/// See `planning/2026-06-09-audio-observability-and-validation-harness-plan.md`
/// Section 4 "Runtime Probe Infrastructure". Do NOT model this on
/// `pulp::view::VisualizationBridge` — that path runs STFT and returns
/// std::vector copies inside the callback (it is explicitly quarantined as
/// non-RT-safe). The RT-safe scalar contract lives here.
///
/// Gating: the whole probe lives behind `PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES`. The
/// release-safe counter subset (`AudioStats`) is always available without this
/// flag. When the flag is OFF, this header still compiles (it is just not
/// instantiated by any runtime), but probe *call sites* in runtime code are
/// `#if PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES`-guarded so an OFF build pays nothing.
