# Pulp Test Fixture

## Overview

A minimal DESIGN.md authored by Pulp's test suite to exercise spec
edges that the upstream paws-and-paths example does not.

## Colors

Primary is `#1A1C1E`. The `accent` token references it so the parser
resolves the reference into the same hex value.

## Typography

Body uses Inter; `fontFeature` and `fontVariation` carry OpenType
feature and variation axis settings through DTCG output verbatim.

## Iconography

This is an UNKNOWN section heading (not in the canonical spec order).
The parser must preserve it without erroring.

## Components

Components reference both color and composite typography tokens to
verify the in-components-only group-ref permission.
