# Debugging "only in the DAW" audio bugs headlessly

When a plugin bug reproduces in a host (Logic, Live, REAPER) but every unit
test is green, you are almost always **testing the wrong layer**. This skill is
the playbook that took a multi-day "audio cuts out when I touch a parameter"
ghost down to a deterministic, no-DAW reproduction in one session.

## The core insight: pick the layer the bug actually lives in

Pulp has two offline harnesses, and they exercise **different code paths**:

| Harness | What it drives | Misses |
|---|---|---|
| `HeadlessHost` (`pulp/format/headless.hpp`) | the `Processor` directly (DSP) | the entire format adapter, the host↔store sync, the render thread, `Globals()` parameter store |
| **Standalone AU host probe** (`AudioComponentInstanceNew` + `AudioUnitRender`) | the **real `.component`** through CoreAudio | nothing — it is the real adapter + render path |

A bug that only shows up in a DAW is, by definition, in something `HeadlessHost`
skips — the adapter, the parameter-sync, threading, or a *dynamic* DSP path the
static scene tests never hit. **Reproduce at the adapter layer first**, then
bisect downward into the Processor once you can trigger it.

## STOP — use the tools that already exist. Do not hand-roll.

These were built deliberately for exactly this. Reaching for a hand-written
`rms_db`/peak loop instead is how a −39 dB ghost ships past a lenient threshold.
**Before writing any audio reproduction or assertion, use one of these:**

| Need | Use (already built) | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Metrics from a rendered buffer (peak/RMS/dBFS, clip, silence, NaN/Inf) | `pulp::audio::analysis::analyze()` → `BufferMetrics` | `pulp/audio/analysis/audio_metrics.hpp` (link `pulp::audio-analysis`) |
| Pass/fail gates in a test | `assert_not_silent`, `assert_no_nan_inf`, `assert_rms_between`, `assert_peak_between`, `assert_frequency_near`, `assert_null_near`, `assert_channels_independent` | `pulp/audio/analysis/audio_assertions.hpp` |
| Fundamental-frequency check | `estimate_frequency()` / `assert_frequency_near()` | `audio_metrics.hpp` / `audio_assertions.hpp` |
| Human-readable buffer report | `summarize(metrics)` | `audio_metrics.hpp` |
| Glitch/artifact + "audio doctor" detection | `audio_artifacts.hpp`, `audio_doctor_artifacts.hpp` | `tools/audio/analysis/` |
| Command-line: render/inspect/compare a WAV without writing C++ | **`pulp audio validate <summarize\|doctor\|compare\|assert>`** (assert checks: `no_nan_inf`, `not_silent`, `silent`, `peak_below`, `frequency_near`) | `tools/cli/cmd_audio_validate.cpp` |
| Live per-callback metering / MIDI log / buffer-underrun capture | `pulp::inspect::AudioInspector` | `inspect/include/pulp/inspect/audio_inspector.hpp` |
| Interactive inspection from an agent session | the **`pulp_inspect_audio`** MCP tool (the Audio Inspector) | MCP |

Rule of thumb: if you typed `std::sqrt`, `* x[i]`, or `20.0 * log10` in a test,
stop — `analyze()` already did it correctly. The only thing you author is the
*stimulus* (what signal, what parameter motion) and the *gate*
(`assert_*(...).passed`).

## Tier 1 — headless Processor scene (DSP bugs)

Fast, deterministic, no Apple frameworks. Use `HeadlessHost` + the offline audio
analysis helpers. Pattern (see `tests/test_scenes.cpp` in a plugin repo):

```cpp
#include <pulp/format/headless.hpp>
#include <pulp/audio/analysis/audio_metrics.hpp>
#include <pulp/audio/analysis/audio_assertions.hpp>

pulp::format::HeadlessHost host(create_my_processor);
host.prepare(48000.0, 512);
// render blocks, optionally mutating params per block via host.state().set_value(...)
auto m = pulp::audio::analysis::analyze(out_view, 48000.0);
REQUIRE(pulp::audio::analysis::assert_not_silent(m).passed);   // the gate that matters
```

**Always use `pulp/audio/analysis` — never hand-roll `rms_db`.** `analyze()` →
`BufferMetrics`; assert with `assert_not_silent`, `assert_no_nan_inf`,
`assert_rms_between`, `assert_frequency_near`, `assert_null_near`,
`assert_channels_independent`. These encode the right thresholds (e.g. the
silence floor) so a test can't "pass" on a −39 dB ghost the way a lenient
hand-written `> -50 dB` check did.

## Tier 2 — standalone AU host probe (adapter / host-interaction / threading bugs)

When Tier 1 is green but the DAW still fails, load the **real component** and
drive it like a host. The reference implementation is
`bendr-pulp/tools/au_host_probe.cpp` — copy and adapt it. It:

1. `AudioComponentFindNext` by `{type, subtype, manufacturer}` (read these from
   the built bundle: `PlistBuddy -c "Print :AudioComponents:0:..."`).
2. `AudioComponentInstanceNew` → `AudioUnitInitialize` with a stream format +
   `MaximumFramesPerSlice` + an input render callback that supplies a tone.
3. Renders on a **background thread** (the host's render thread) via
   `AudioUnitRender` while the **main thread** mutates a parameter — either via
   `AudioUnitSetParameter` (host path) or, to faithfully mimic the plugin's own
   editor, by fetching the `StateStore` through the editor-context property
   (`kPulpEditorContextProperty` = `'PuEd'`, struct `{Processor*, StateStore*}`)
   and running a real `pulp::state::ParameterEdit` gesture.
4. Measures per-block output peak and flags it if output dies after a change.

Build/run (the probe does **offline render to memory — no speakers**, so no
audio-etiquette concern):

```bash
cp -R build/AU/MyPlug.component ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache; killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar
./build/au-host-probe   # exits non-zero if the bug reproduces
```

This is the tool to reach for whenever someone says "can we automate this
instead of me testing in Logic." It works on any Pulp AU plugin.

## Step 0 — check the crash logs BEFORE any bisect

In Logic, multiple AUs share one `AUHostingServiceXPC` process. If touching
plugin A reliably kills plugin B's audio (e.g. the upstream software
instrument dies until reopened), suspect a **crash of the shared process**,
not a stall — and the guilty binary can be a *different plugin* than the one
being touched. **Before bisecting anything:**

```bash
ls -t ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/ | head    # AUHostingServiceXPC_*.ips
```

Parse the `.ips`: the `asiBacktraces` field holds the original throw-site
backtrace with the guilty image name. Two gotchas: macOS **throttles duplicate
crash reports** (repeat wedges may not write new files), and an uncaught
ObjC exception in `drawRect:` is **fatal to the whole process** (AppKit
`_crashOnException`) — one plugin's paint bug silences every plugin in the
process. A multi-day "wedge" hunt across params/DSP/GPU was solved in minutes
once the crash log was read. (SDK hardening from that incident: UTF-8-safe
`text_x_for_byte`, `ns_string_never_nil` in the CG canvas, and a `@try/@catch`
guard around the plugin-view paint.)

## The decisive measurement, not a guess

Once reproduced, the single most localizing fact for a cutout is: **is the host
still calling render, and is input vs output silent?**
- render still called + **input full, output silent** → the *plugin* is emitting
  silence (DSP or adapter), not the host muting it.
- render stops being called → the host disabled the AU (a returned error, a
  render-thread stall).

`os_log`/`runtime::log` does **not** surface from Logic's sandboxed
AUHostingService process. To watch the live render path in-host, write a
throttled trace to a **file** (`/tmp/...`) from `ProcessBufferLists` and
`tail -f` it over SSH. Better: reproduce in the probe and read state directly.

## Sweep the parameter and measure LEVEL — the move that cracks DSP bugs

The single highest-leverage diagnostic when "audio breaks when I touch a
control": **render at a sweep of STATIC values across the parameter's full
range, measure the output LEVEL at each, and toggle each related mode on/off.**
The differential pattern localizes the broken stage in one table:

```cpp
for (bool mode_on : {true, false})
  for (float v : {0.f, 3.f, 6.f, 9.f, 12.f}) {
    HeadlessHost host(create_my_processor); host.prepare(48000, 512);
    host.state().set_value(kSomeMode, mode_on); host.state().set_value(kParam, v);
    auto out = render(host, tone);
    auto m = pulp::audio::analysis::analyze(out_view, 48000);
    printf("mode=%d param=%.1f -> %.2f dBFS\n", mode_on, v, m.max_rms());
  }
```

A real worked example: "audio cuts out when I change a parameter" was NOT a
threading/adapter bug and NOT a rate-of-change latch (two wrong theories that
cost hours). The level sweep showed instantly:

```
preserve=1 pitch= 0 st -> -9 dB     preserve=0 pitch= 0 st -> -9 dB
preserve=1 pitch= 6 st -> -34 dB    preserve=0 pitch= 6 st -> -9 dB
preserve=1 pitch=7.2 st -> -39 dB   preserve=0 pitch=7.2 st -> -9 dB
```

→ a **static** level collapse confined to the formant-preserve path,
progressive with pitch. That pinned it to `SpectralEnvelopeShifter` (the
envelope correction wasn't energy-preserving, so a narrow-band tone was scaled
by the falling envelope above its peak). One sweep replaced days of guessing.

**Measure LEVEL, never only frequency.** The bug above rendered the *correct
frequency* the whole time — every existing scene checked `peak_hz` / frequency
and passed at −39 dB. `assert_frequency_near` alone is a trap; pair it with
`assert_rms_between` / `assert_not_silent`.

## Also test the rate and the toggles

Beyond the static sweep, for every continuous parameter add a **rapid-jump**
scene (change every 1–2 blocks, then settle and assert recovery) and a
**rapid-toggle** scene for booleans — these catch genuine *latching* state
(an edge handler or accumulator that self-sustains). Run the **AU host probe in
CI** gating on output staying alive across scripted parameter automation; it
exercises the adapter+render path no headless scene can.

If you discover a failure mode, add the scene to `test_scenes.cpp` AND extend
the probe so it can never regress.

## What this caught (worked examples)

- **Formant-preserve pitch-up silenced the output** (the headline bug): static
  level collapse in `SpectralEnvelopeShifter`, found by the level sweep above,
  fixed with energy-preserving normalization. Frequency-only tests missed it.
- **Param edits reverting in-host** (XY snap-back, type-in not taking): the AU
  adapter's per-block `GetParameter → store` pull clobbered UI writes. Tier-2;
  fixed by a host↔store reconcile. See `au-param-host-store-clobber`.
- **Audio-thread `AUEventListenerNotify`** stalling Logic's render thread on
  every param change. Tier-2; never call it from `ProcessBufferLists`.
