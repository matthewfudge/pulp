# Host Compatibility Matrix

Tracks which DAWs Pulp plug-ins have been validated against, per format and
capability. Maintained alongside `planning/production-readiness/STATUS.md` —
when an entry moves from `unvalidated` to `stable` here, the corresponding
row in STATUS can claim `production_validated: true`.

The point of the matrix is to prevent optimism drift: "it compiled" ≠
"it works in Cubase." Adding a row here means a human loaded a Pulp plug-in
in that host and exercised the capability.

**Status legend:**
- ✅ **stable** — validated on latest host release, no known issues
- 🟡 **usable** — loads and runs; at least one known quirk documented below
- 🔴 **broken** — loads but produces incorrect results
- — **unvalidated** — nobody has tried yet

## Validation recipe

For a (host, format, capability) row:

1. Build the reference plug-in with `PULP_ENABLE_ARA=ON` (if the capability is ARA) or the plain profile otherwise.
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPULP_ENABLE_ARA=ON -DPULP_ARA_SDK_DIR=$PWD/external/ara-sdk
   cmake --build build --target AraPitchTracker-CLAP PulpCompressor-VST3 PulpSynth-CLAP
   ```
2. Install to the host's scan path (`~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`, `~/.clap`, etc.).
3. Launch the host; confirm the plug-in appears in its browser.
4. For each capability column: load a project that exercises it.
   - **Params**: automate one from the host, confirm roundtrip.
   - **MIDI**: route from a MIDI track; confirm note-on reaches `process()`.
   - **Sidechain**: activate a second bus; confirm `sidechain_input()` returns non-null.
   - **Multi-bus**: instantiate with multiple output buses, verify channel assignment.
   - **ARA**: for Cubase/Studio One/Logic — drop an audio clip on the plug-in's track, open the ARA editor, confirm `begin_editing` logs (see `examples/ara-pitch-tracker/`).
5. Update the cell in this file from `—` to ✅/🟡/🔴 and, if non-stable, add a "Notes" entry below.
