"""Merge N Cobertura XML reports into a single XML.

Motivation
==========
Pulp's CI produces one Cobertura XML per OS (Linux / macOS / Windows)
because llvm-profdata merge is not architecture-portable. The
`coverage-diff-gate` workflow historically passed only the Linux XML
to diff-cover, which silently skipped platform-specific source files
(e.g. ``core/format/src/au_adapter.mm``, ``core/format/src/au_v2_*``,
any Apple-only ``.mm`` / Windows-only ``*_win.cpp``) because those
files never appear in the Linux build. PRs touching platform-specific
code therefore bypassed the 75% diff-cover gate entirely. See
pulp issue #635.

This script merges N Cobertura XMLs into one. For every ``(filename,
line_number)`` key that appears in any input XML, the merged output
reports ``max(hits)`` across the inputs. Files that only exist in one
XML (e.g. au_adapter.mm on macOS) carry through unchanged. Files that
exist in multiple XMLs with different hit counts (cross-platform code
measured on all three OSes) get the UNION — a line covered on any OS
counts as covered overall.

This is exactly the semantic diff-cover needs: "of the lines this PR
adds, how many are covered *somewhere*?" Cross-OS unions happen here,
once, before diff-cover runs; diff-cover itself remains a single-XML
tool and its output remains one comment per PR.

Usage
=====

    python3 merge_cobertura.py \\
        --out merged.cobertura.xml \\
        linux.cobertura.xml macos.cobertura.xml windows.cobertura.xml

Missing inputs are skipped with a warning on stderr (the merged XML
still writes; diff-cover needs *something* to compare against). If
every input is missing, the script exits non-zero.

The output XML is a minimal Cobertura document: one synthetic
``<package>``, all ``<class>`` entries flattened into it, each with a
``<lines>`` list containing the union of lines from every input. The
top-level ``lines-valid`` / ``lines-covered`` attributes are recomputed
from the merged line set; everything else (branch-rate per class,
methods) is passed through from the first input where a given file
appears — merging those fields across XMLs is not meaningful for
diff-cover, which reads only line-hit data.

def parse_xml(path: Path) -> dict[str, dict[int, int]]:

    Ignores branch data, methods, and timestamps — diff-cover's line
    coverage only reads ``<line number=... hits=...>``. Multiple
    ``<class>`` entries for the same filename (possible when a single
    source is compiled into multiple TUs) are accumulated via
    ``max()`` so we never regress a hit to 0.

    Raises ``CorruptCoberturaError`` when the file exists but cannot
    be parsed as XML. The caller is expected to surface this as a
    distinct exit code so CI can fail the gate rather than treating
    a parse failure as a benign "missing input".
