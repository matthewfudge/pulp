# Design Debugging

Use `pulp design-debug` to exercise the design-tool chat pipeline non-interactively
and publish reproducible artifacts for review.

This tool is useful when you want to:
- compare prompts side by side
- replay a saved model response without calling AI again
- keep provider/model/reasoning-effort metadata with the screenshots
- inspect which tokens, dimensions, and widget looks changed
- upload artifact bundles to GitHub or share them remotely

## What It Produces

Each run writes an artifact bundle under `build/design-debug/` by default:

- `*-prompt.txt`
- `*-response.txt`
- `*-debug-state.json`
- `*-apply-summary.txt`
- `*-before.png`
- `*-after.png`
- `*-diff.png`
- `*-report.json`
- `*-target-before.png` / `*-target-after.png` / `*-target-diff.png` for targeted widget runs
- `latest-report.json` with the newest full report
- `latest-run.json` with a compact summary of the newest run
- `runs.jsonl` with one JSON summary per run for remote progress tracking

The JSON report includes:
- provider, model, reasoning effort
- requested capture backend and actual render backend
- whether widget SkSL was rendered in the artifact images
- target widget id and bounds
- target-region crop bounds and ROI diff stats for targeted runs (`target_diff_pixels`, `target_diff_pct`)
- the exact AI command or live driver command used
- screenshot diff stats
- `debug_state` from the real design tool script:
  - request text
  - changed colors
  - changed dimensions
  - widget look ids
  - summary / error state

## Examples

Target one widget:

```bash
pulp design-debug \
  --prompt "make the gain knob look like macOS 7" \
  --target k1
```

Run a Codex/OpenAI model with explicit reasoning effort:

```bash
pulp design-debug \
  --prompt "make the gain knob look like a precision analyzer control with restrained chrome" \
  --target k1 \
  --provider codex \
  --model gpt-5.4 \
  --reasoning-effort low
```

Restyle the whole preview with Claude:

```bash
pulp design-debug \
  --prompt "design a cyberpunk interface for a modern synth plugin" \
  --target all \
  --provider claude \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-6
```

Replay a saved response:

```bash
pulp design-debug \
  --prompt "warm analog EQ" \
  --target all \
  --response-file saved-response.json
```

## Provider and Model Metadata

The interactive `pulp design` app and the headless `pulp design-debug` harness
share the same prompt builder and AI command-template expansion.

Today the design tool exposes:
- provider: `Claude` or `Codex`
- provider-specific model selector
- reasoning-effort selector for Codex/OpenAI models

That metadata is preserved in the debug report so you can compare:
- Claude vs Codex
- `gpt-5.4` vs another Codex/OpenAI model
- `low` vs `xhigh` reasoning effort

For targeted widget runs, the harness also emits target-only crops and ROI stats
so you can answer the important question quickly:

- did the selected widget materially change?
- was the change localized to the intended control?
- which prompt/model combination produced the strongest targeted delta?

The report records `target_region_source` so you can tell whether the crop came
from the requested widget bounds or a changed-pixels fallback.

## Capture Backends

The debug tool supports three render paths:

- `--capture-backend skia` (default)
- `--capture-backend coregraphics`
- `--capture-backend live-gpu`

The default Skia path makes the harness much more useful for widget restyling,
because widget SkSL actually renders in the screenshots. The report makes this explicit:

```json
{
  "render_backend": "skia-headless",
  "requested_capture_backend": "skia",
  "sksl_gpu_supported": false,
  "widget_sksl_render_supported": true
}
```

The CoreGraphics path is still available, but it does not faithfully render
custom widget SkSL and is mainly useful as a baseline/comparison path.

The live GPU path launches the real `pulp-design-tool` app in automation mode,
captures before/after frames from the actual Skia/Graphite renderer, and writes
those images back into the same artifact bundle:

```json
{
  "render_backend": "skia-live-gpu",
  "requested_capture_backend": "live-gpu",
  "sksl_gpu_supported": true,
  "widget_sksl_render_supported": true
}
```

Useful when you need proof from the same renderer the interactive app uses:

```bash
pulp design-debug \
  --prompt "make the gain knob look like premium brushed aluminum" \
  --target k1 \
  --capture-backend live-gpu
```

## Current Limitation

The headless `skia` backend still renders offscreen rather than through the
final live GPU presentation path used by the interactive app.

That means the headless harness is very good for:
- validating prompt construction
- validating provider/model/reasoning metadata
- validating JSON parsing and apply flow
- validating widget SkSL shape/material changes in before/after screenshots
- comparing token/dimension/widget-look diffs
- publishing deterministic before/after/report bundles

When you need final renderer fidelity inside the harness itself, use
`--capture-backend live-gpu`.

## Testing

Relevant local checks:

```bash
node --check examples/design-tool/design-tool.js
ctest --test-dir build -R "Design tool:|WidgetBridge"
./build/tools/design/pulp-design-debug --prompt "make the gain knob look like premium brushed aluminum" --target k1 --capture-backend live-gpu --response-file saved-response.json
```

Those tests cover the prompt builder, provider/model selector behavior, debug-state
capture, and the widget-restyling bridge APIs. The live-gpu command above is the
best local smoke test when you want a report bundle from the actual GPU-backed app.
