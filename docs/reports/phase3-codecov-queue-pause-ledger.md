# Phase 3 Codecov Queue Pause Ledger

Last updated: 2026-05-15 01:21 PDT

This local ledger records the open `codecov` PR validation runs paused to free Namespace capacity for higher-priority work, plus the small-batch resume queue. Branches, PRs, commits, labels, and tracker comments stay intact; queued GitHub Actions validation attempts are cancellable and replaceable.

2026-05-14 update: CI is no longer fully paused, but Namespace and SSH
targets remain intentionally out of scope. New batches should use
GitHub Actions hosted PR workflows, with macOS validated locally before
push when useful and Linux/Windows left to hosted Actions. The old
Namespace-specific notes below are retained as history for older PRs and
should not be read as current dispatch guidance.

Batch size guidance after reopening GitHub-hosted CI: prefer larger
coherent test-only batches over one-tranche PRs. A good batch is one
related code area, one or a small number of test binaries, and enough
coverage work to justify a full hosted CI cycle. Do not depend on merge
queues; each batch PR should stand alone, run the normal required
pull-request checks, and merge directly once green. Keep source behavior
fixes, version-bump changes, and platform-only branches separate unless
the shared validation target makes the combined risk clearly lower.

## Queue Policy

- Reopen Codecov validation in small batches; do not dump the full paused queue back into Namespace at once.
- While a batch is in flight, continue local-only tranche preparation, review, and failure triage.
- Merge `UNSTABLE` PRs only when GitHub branch protection shows all required checks are green and the PR can merge normally.
- For merge eligibility after a pause, refresh PR branches with `gh pr update-branch <pr>` so GitHub creates fresh `pull_request` check suites.
- Use `shipyard cloud run build <branch> --provider namespace --require-sha <sha> --no-wait` only as a Namespace smoke or targeted diagnostic; successful `workflow_dispatch` checks do not replace stale failed or cancelled `pull_request` contexts for branch protection.
- If one lane is slow or stuck, prefer `shipyard cloud retarget`/`shipyard cloud add-lane` so existing useful runs are preserved instead of cancelled wholesale.
- Branch protection currently requires the lower-case `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` contexts. The visible Namespace child jobs may appear as
  `Linux (x64) [namespace]`, `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`, and
  `Windows (x64) [namespace]`; wait for the lower-case reusable-workflow
  wrappers to settle before declaring a PR mergeable.

## Draft CI Resume Plan

This is planning only. Do not push, update PR branches, dispatch CI, or
merge until Namespace capacity is explicitly reopened.

When CI resumes, use a two-stage loop:

1. Local readiness sweep. For each held branch, confirm clean status,
   rebase onto the then-current `origin/main`, run the ledger's focused
   build/test target plus sync/version/diff guards, and classify the
   branch as `ready`, `conflict`, `test-fail`, `duplicate/upstream`,
   `platform-only`, or `source-fix/version-bump`.
2. CI waves. Push or update only `ready` branches in waves of roughly
   3-5 PRs. Let PR-event checks run naturally; avoid extra
   `workflow_dispatch` diagnostics unless a specific failure needs it.
   Merge green PRs as they clear required checks, quarantine failures,
   and keep the next wave moving if Namespace capacity is still healthy.

Use individual PRs for already-open branches unless we intentionally
supersede one. For local-only branches with no remote PR, it is valid to
create a combined batch PR when the tranches are tightly related,
test-only, and touch the same target/file family. Good candidates for a
combined PR include the #640 `test/test_audio_file.cpp` audio-file
tranches, after one final local rebase/re-smoke. Do not combine source
behavior fixes with test-only branches; keep those separate so version
bump and regression risk stay obvious.

Batch-prep rule while CI remains paused: prepare combined branches
locally only, roughly 3-8 closely related test-only tranches per branch,
then run all touched target builds, focused tags, full touched binaries,
CTest selectors, sync/version/docs/compat guards, and diff checks before
recording the batch here. Do not push or open the batch PR until CI
capacity is explicitly available. Avoid active development overlap,
including #2009's mac platform-test harness / back-buffer capture seam.
The first low-conflict batch candidate is the #640 audio-file cluster
(`local/phase3-audio-data-shape-640`, `local/phase3-aiff-pcm-edges-640`,
and `local/phase3-streaming-writer-reopen-640`) because it is
test-only, shares `test/test_audio_file.cpp`, and does not touch #2009's
files.

Failure handling during CI waves:

- If a PR has a real code/test failure, mark it `quarantined`, keep the
  failure logs, and continue merging unrelated green PRs.
- If the failure is external or infrastructure-like, such as SDK
  download/DNS failures, mark it `rerun-only` and do not patch code
  unless the same failure reproduces locally or points at branch code.
- If Codecov patch/diff coverage fails, use that PR's report to add the
  smallest local coverage fix, then requeue that PR in a later wave.
- If a branch is already absorbed by `origin/main`, close/supersede it
  rather than spending another CI run.
- Required lower-case `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrapper contexts
  still decide mergeability; successful diagnostic dispatches do not
  replace stale or failed PR-event contexts.

Proposed CI cutover plan for discussion:

1. Stop starting new coverage tranches once the current local tranche is
   recorded. Keep only rebase/re-smoke and failure-fix work active until
   the first CI wave is settled.
2. Run a final no-CI sweep over the first-wave candidates: fetch,
   confirm the branch is clean, rebase onto the then-current
   `origin/main`, rerun the focused test target plus full test binary,
   CTest selector, CLI skew/sync guard, skill/version/docs/compat reports,
   and diff checks. Mark anything that fails locally as `quarantined`
   before it reaches Namespace.
3. Start with one canary wave of the already-current, test-only PRs:
   #1274 CLI ship, #1287 CLI audio, #1269 design-import bundle, #1271
   create-targets, and #1273 package commands. Add #1286 NamedPipe only if
   capacity is healthy after those dispatch.
4. Let the whole wave finish instead of stopping at the first red PR.
   Merge green PRs as soon as required PR-event `linux`, `macos`, and
   `windows` contexts are green. Move red PRs to `quarantined` or
   `rerun-only` with their failure class, then keep the next unrelated
   wave moving if capacity remains available.
5. For held local-only tranches, reduce cycles by forming batch PRs only
   when scopes are naturally related, test-only, and share a target/file
   family. The best first combined candidates are the #640
   `test/test_audio_file.cpp` audio-file tranches. Keep source-fix branches
   such as AudioFocus separate because they need explicit version-bump
   handling.
6. For already-open PRs, assume each PR eventually needs its own required
   PR-event contexts unless we intentionally close/supersede it with a
   combined PR. A diagnostic `workflow_dispatch` run can find failures
   cheaply, but it does not make an existing PR mergeable under branch
   protection.
7. After each wave, update this ledger with `green/merged`,
   `quarantined`, `rerun-only`, `superseded`, or `needs-local-fix`, then
   build the next wave from the remaining ready queue.

no Namespace dispatch and no SSH targets. Resume action: monitor #2014
required checks and merge directly when green.

2026-05-14 23:04 PDT: prepared the next larger #640 platform/runtime
batch locally as `feature/phase3-platform-runtime-batch-640` at

Resume action: push/open as one GitHub-hosted PR when active hosted
batch pressure drops; do not run Namespace or SSH targets.

2026-05-14 23:42 PDT: created the broad GitHub-hosted coverage wave
`feature/phase3-tools-cli-batch-643` at `4167e133`, PR #2016, based on
current `origin/main` `7a532c59` after #2009 and the 0.100.0 changelog
landed. This intentionally supersedes the smaller pushed
`feature/phase3-platform-runtime-batch-640` durability branch, plus
`local/phase3-audio-tools-model-store-643`,
`local/phase3-cli-config-command-643`,
`local/phase3-ruleset-drift-config-643`,
`local/phase3-fetchcontent-cache-edges-643`,
`local/phase3-auto-release-extra-643`,
`local/phase3-check-format-validation-coverage-643`,
`local/phase3-pkg-freshness-extra-643`, and
`feature/phase3-sdl3-surface-fallback-646`. `local/phase3-frame-fill-edges-640`
was checked but pruned because equivalent frame-fill coverage is already
on `origin/main` in `test/test_frame_fill.cpp`.

Local macOS validation passed on the combined #2016 branch: target build
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-audio-tools
pulp-test-cli-shellout pulp-test-cli-fetchcontent-cache
pulp-test-environment pulp-test-child-process pulp-test-sdl3-surface
-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, focused runs for
`[audio][tools][issue-643]`, `[cli][shellout][config][issue-643]`,
`[fetchcontent_cache][issue-643]`, `[environment][issue-640]`,
`[child_process][edge][issue-640]`, and `[render][sdl3][issue-646]`,
full touched binaries for audio tools, FetchContent cache, environment,
child process, and SDL3 surface, plus direct Python unit tests for
`tools/scripts/test_auto_release_decision_extra.py`,
`tools/scripts/test_check_format_validation.py`,
`tools/scripts/test_ruleset_drift_config.py`, and
`tools/packages/test_freshness_check_extra.py`. `git diff --check`,
skill-sync, version-bump, docs-sync, and compat-sync reports passed.
The pre-push local diff-cover gate was demoted with
`PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1` because its local coverage configure
could not fetch the pinned Highway tree; GitHub Actions remains the
authoritative CI gate for this PR. Resume action: monitor #2016 required
GitHub-hosted checks and merge directly when green; do not use Namespace
or SSH targets.

2026-05-15 00:16 PDT: created the #493 view/widget coverage wave
`feature/phase3-view-widget-batch-493` at `8f9effa7`, PR #2017, based on
current `origin/main` `7a532c59`. The branch batches 18 local test-only
tranches into one 17-file diff touching only test sources:
AppearanceTracker, AudioBridge, AutoUi, CodeEditor document/MRU paths,
GraphEditorView paint/drag paths, GUI components, ImageCache trim,
InputEvents, ModalOverlay, ParamAttachment, Phase9 widgets, TreeView,
UI components, VisualizationBridge, WaveformEditor, generic widgets, and
WindowManager. Excluded source-fix, version-bump, docs/skill, and CMake
target-creation tranches from this wave.

Local macOS validation passed for #2017: configure with GPU/examples off

2026-05-15 00:18 PDT: refreshed #2012 after GitHub-hosted macOS exposed
a parallel test isolation issue outside the audio-file diff. The failed
check was `Build and Test / macOS (ARM64) [github-hosted]`; its log
showed `read_midi_file falls back for non-PPQ divisions` failing because
`read.has_value()` was false. The failing test used a `TempDir` name
based only on `steady_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count()`, so
parallel Catch/CTest processes could collide on the same temp path and
one destructor could remove another process's fixture files. The fix adds
random-device entropy to the MIDI-file `TempDir` name. Revalidated on
macOS after rebasing onto `origin/main` `b70bd42a`: build
`pulp-test-audio-file` and `pulp-test-midi-file`, focused
`./build/test/pulp-test-audio-file "[audio][file][issue-640]" -r compact`
passing 308 assertions in 16 test cases, full `pulp-test-audio-file`
passing 561 assertions in 33 test cases, and
`ctest --test-dir build -R "read_midi_file" -j 8 --output-on-failure`
passing 4/4. `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`,
skill-sync, version-bump, docs-sync, and compat-sync reports passed.
Force-with-lease pushed `feature/phase3-audio-file-batch-640` to
`18333207`; resume action is to monitor the fresh GitHub-hosted
pull-request checks and merge #2012 directly when green.

2026-05-15 00:20 PDT: created the #645/#493 MIDI/host format batch
`feature/phase3-midi-host-batch-645` at `62a17f78`, PR #2019, based on
current `origin/main` `b70bd42a`. The branch is test-only and touches
`test/test_mpe_buffer.cpp`, `test/test_diagnostic_reporter.cpp`,
`test/test_descriptor_validation.cpp`, and `test/test_scan_blacklist.cpp`.
It adds MPE buffer equal-offset/move-add/tracker sample-offset coverage,
diagnostic reporter default and JSON output coverage, HostType resize and
sidechain feature heuristics, descriptor validation warning/error
combinations, and scan blacklist parser edge coverage.

Local macOS validation passed for #2019: build `pulp-test-mpe-buffer`,
`pulp-test-diagnostic`, `pulp-test-descriptor-validation`, and
`pulp-test-scan-blacklist`; focused `"[issue-645]"` MPE run passed 20
assertions in 3 test cases; focused `"[issue-493]"` diagnostic,
descriptor-validation, and scan-blacklist runs passed 26 assertions in 3
test cases, 34 assertions in 9 test cases, and 16 assertions in 3 test
cases respectively; full touched binaries passed 39 assertions in 6 test
cases, 46 assertions in 10 test cases, 50 assertions in 19 test cases,
and 42 assertions in 12 test cases respectively. `git diff --check
origin/main...HEAD`, `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`,
skill-sync, version-bump, docs-sync, and compat-sync reports passed.
Branch pushed and PR opened with GitHub-hosted CI only; no Namespace or
SSH dispatch. Resume action: monitor #2019 required checks and merge
directly when green.

2026-05-15 00:32 PDT: created the #493 host graph/serializer batch
`feature/phase3-host-graph-batch-493` at `276f7f7`, PR #2022, based on
current `origin/main` `a29cb7dc`. The branch touches
`core/host/src/graph_serializer.cpp`, `test/test_host.cpp`, and
`test/test_graph_serializer.cpp`. It adds SignalGraph coverage for
missing-node and duplicate edge variants across audio/feedback/MIDI,
live gain updates without re-prepare, release silence behavior,
non-plugin parameter helper returns, prepare guard returns, and clear
state reset. It adds GraphSerializer coverage for unresolved-plugin
identity reserialization without state blobs and for field-error cleanup
after a partially loaded graph. The one-line source fix routes missing
plugin placeholders through the existing `add_plugin_node(info)` path so
GraphNode preserves the serialized PluginInfo identity when a saved
plugin cannot be resolved.

Local macOS validation passed for #2022: configured Debug with GPU and
examples off, built `pulp-test-host` and `pulp-test-graph-serializer`,
focused `./build/test/pulp-test-host "[host][graph][issue-493]" -r
compact` passed 88 assertions in 3 test cases, focused
`./build/test/pulp-test-graph-serializer
"[host][serializer][issue-493]" -r compact` passed 33 assertions in 5
test cases, full `pulp-test-host -r compact` passed 1126 assertions in
31 test cases, and full `pulp-test-graph-serializer -r compact` passed
382 assertions in 16 test cases. `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`,
`git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`,
`python3 tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py`,
`tools/scripts/cli_version_check.sh`, and `./tools/check-docs.sh`
passed; docs check reported only existing warnings. Local pre-push
diff-cover was demoted because its coverage configure path failed while
fetching Highway commit `457c891775a7397bdb0376bb1031e6e027af1c48`
before test execution. Branch pushed and PR opened with GitHub-hosted CI
only; no Namespace or SSH dispatch. Resume action: monitor #2022
required checks and merge directly when green.

2026-05-15 00:45 PDT: created the #643 tools Python control-plane batch
`feature/phase3-tools-python-batch-643` at `50acc069`, PR #2024, from
current `origin/main` `a29cb7dc`. The diff is test-only and adds
`tools/scripts/test_host_pump_lint.py`,
`tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release_extra.py`, and
`tools/scripts/test_macos_reroute_watcher.py`. Coverage areas include
host-pump lint pairing, window, skip-marker, and main-result paths;
release Skia fetcher usage, platform, manifest, checksum, unpack, and
layout-drift paths; and macOS reroute watcher subprocess wrapping, local
busy checks, cloud lane labeling, BAT queue parsing, reroute
success/failure/timeout, flap-guard trimming, and `tick()` busy,
candidate, and flap behavior.

Local macOS validation passed for #2024: `python3 -m unittest
tools.scripts.test_host_pump_lint
tools.scripts.test_fetch_skia_for_release_extra
tools.scripts.test_macos_reroute_watcher` passed 17 tests; combined
`python3 -m unittest tools.scripts.test_fetch_skia_for_release
tools.scripts.test_fetch_skia_for_release_extra
tools.scripts.test_host_pump_lint
tools.scripts.test_macos_reroute_watcher` passed 27 tests; direct script
runs for the three new tests passed; `python3 -m py_compile

tools/scripts/macos_reroute_watcher.py
tools/scripts/test_host_pump_lint.py

tools/scripts/test_macos_reroute_watcher.py` passed; `git diff --check

`python3 tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py`,
`tools/scripts/cli_version_check.sh`, and `./tools/check-docs.sh`
passed. Local `tools/scripts/run_python_coverage.py` could not run
because the installed coverage.py is below the required `>=7.10` floor.
The broader `python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/scripts -p
'test_*lint.py'` sweep hit the existing unrelated
`tools/scripts/test_workflow_lint.py` workflow-step expectation for
`Release-pipeline regression tests (#720)`. Local pre-push diff-cover
was demoted because its coverage configure path failed fetching Highway
commit `457c891775a7397bdb1031e6e027af1c48` before tests. Branch pushed
and PR opened with GitHub-hosted CI only; no Namespace or SSH dispatch.
Resume action: monitor #2024 required checks and merge directly when
green.

2026-05-15 00:56 PDT: created the #641 runtime/state utility batch
`feature/phase3-runtime-state-batch-641` at `dda4d1e`, PR #2025, from
current `origin/main` `a29cb7dc`. The diff is test-only and touches
`test/test_properties_file.cpp`, `test/test_state_tree.cpp`, and
`test/test_runtime_utils.cpp`. Coverage areas include PropertiesFile
bool-string interpretation, non-object JSON failure state, unsupported
JSON member filtering, directory save failure, and missing-key/empty
clear no-ops; StateTree typed getter fallback, invalid child indexes,
insert-at-end and missing-pointer removal, property listener old/new
values, remove-without-callback behavior, JSON filtering and default
node type, deep-copy child parent rewiring, ObservableValue assignment,
CachedProperty mismatched external updates, StateTreeSynchroniser
reattach, empty batches, and truncated-batch prefix preservation; and
runtime utility coverage for TemporaryFile extension normalization,
move-assignment cleanup, self-move ownership, MemoryMappedFile reopen,
and Range integer/double boundary behavior.

Local macOS validation passed for #2025: configured Debug with GPU and
examples off, built `pulp-test-properties`, `pulp-test-state-tree`, and
`pulp-test-runtime-utils`, focused
`./build/test/pulp-test-properties "[issue-641]" -r compact` passed 24
assertions in 5 test cases, focused
`./build/test/pulp-test-state-tree "[issue-641]" -r compact` passed 55

`./build/test/pulp-test-runtime-utils "[issue-641]" -r compact` passed
88 assertions in 18 test cases, full `pulp-test-properties -r compact`
passed 75 assertions in 22 test cases, full `pulp-test-state-tree -r
compact` passed 171 assertions in 43 test cases, full
`pulp-test-runtime-utils -r compact` passed 150 assertions in 43 test
cases, and exact `ctest --test-dir build -R
"PropertiesFile|StateTree|TemporaryFile|MemoryMappedFile|Range"
--output-on-failure` passed 76/76 tests. `git diff --check
origin/main...HEAD`, `git diff --check`, `git diff --cached --check`,
`python3 tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py`,
`tools/scripts/cli_version_check.sh`, and `./tools/check-docs.sh`
passed; docs check reported existing warnings. Local pre-push diff-cover
was intentionally disabled after the focused/full local validation
because this is a test-only batch. Branch pushed and PR opened with
GitHub-hosted CI only; no Namespace or SSH dispatch. Resume action:
monitor #2025 required checks and merge directly when green.

  Read-only reconciliation on 2026-05-14 found current `origin/main`
  at `c98896dbc`, with the former first-wave and adjacent held PRs
  already landed: #1269 as `0b3c9493`, #1271 as `c45ee4ae`, #1273 as

  `4d3f907b`, and #1285 as `57835f59`. Do not spend local validation
  cycles on those stale branches; use them only as historical evidence.
  The remaining `92e83b37` local-only candidates still need one final
  rebase/re-smoke before any CI resume.
  Rebase/re-smoke any held branch against the then-current base before a
  later push/CI resume.
  The refreshed #493 NewWidgets input, FileBrowser paint, AppearanceManager,
  and TreeView tranches were validated on `9a67a517` and are now behind
  the latest local `origin/main`; keep them local-only and rebase/re-smoke
  before any later push/CI resume. The remaining #493 view tranches
  recorded on `83271a94`, plus older #643 CLI/tool and #493/#640 tranches
  on `24047ba3` or older bases, remain behind as well.

`feature/phase3-popup-menu-coverage-640` at remote/local head

`0447498e` already covers the same PopupMenu item metadata and non-Apple
stub no-selection paths in `test/test_file_dialog.cpp`. Treat #1276 as
low-value duplicate coverage during the pause. Resume note: when
Namespace capacity returns, either close/supersede #1276 after a final
Codecov/code check, or retarget it to a platform gap that is not already
covered by `origin/main`.

The earlier #1272 Android failure remains classified as external
infrastructure: Gradle could not resolve `dl.google.com` while
installing Build-Tools 34. The PR later merged as
`cb641ff19c16ce0115e3dae7c04e5c2fa5a62760`; if the same failure
reappears on another Android coverage tranche, treat it as rerun-only,
not a code patch, once the workflow is in a safe rerunnable state.

  `ef4303856482580beb5dcc4c15a7f22a2715454a` after required wrappers and
  Codecov patch were green; only advisory/non-blocking checks were active.

  `feature/phase3-docs-generate-coverage-643`, head `7d9b34c6a985`.
  Applied `codecov`, linked #641/#643, and PR-event checks are
  queued/running. Local validation after rebasing onto `origin/main` at
  `f6e092ba6475` included 15 docs-generator tests,
  `tools/docs_generate.py check`, focused 100% coverage for
  `tools/docs_generate.py`, and diff checks.
- GitHub Actions pressure: #1231, #1239, #1240, and #1241 have PR-event
  Build/Coverage checks active or queued on Namespace-backed lanes and no
  failed checks. The newer batch is draining normally.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-check-docs-status-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `36e80fe7` against `origin/main` at `ef430385`; 10
  format-validation tests, 23 coverage-runner tests, warn-mode format
  validation, focused coverage, and diff checks passed. Warn mode still
  reports 4 existing missing `production_validated` entries.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-websocket-channel-edges-641`
  refreshed cleanly at `7b86ded8` with direct WebSocket tests, 11 matching
  CTest cases, and a narrowed coverage/diff-cover mirror green. A follow-up
  worker reconfirmed the branch is still based on `origin/main` at
  `8a9eadc47004`, clean, one commit ahead, and limited to
  `test/test_websocket_channel.cpp`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-eq-curve-view-edges-493` refreshed
  cleanly at `e1367951` with direct `[eq_curve]` widget tests, 4 matching
  CTest cases, and diff scope limited to `test/test_phase9_widgets.cpp`.
- Refill progress: `pulp-phase3-theme-io-validation-493` is now queued as
  #1240 at `af241124` with direct `[theme]` tests, 17 matching CTest cases,
  and diff scope limited to `test/test_theme.cpp`.
- Local-only audit: `pulp-phase3-canvas-fallback-edges-641` was rebased to
  `origin/main` at `69bbe8a4`; the old local patch was already absorbed
  upstream as `42464b4b` / #1201, so no reopen action is needed. Validation
  still passed: `pulp-test-canvas "[canvas][fallback]"` reported 62
  assertions in 4 test cases.
- Local-only audit: `pulp-phase3-rectangle-list-edges-641` was rebased to
  `origin/main` at `f6e092ba`; the old local patch was already absorbed
  upstream as `9d1e7d66` / #1203. Validation still passed:
  `pulp-test-rectangle-list` reported 60 assertions in 16 test cases and
  matching CTest passed 16/16.
- Refill progress: `pulp-docs-generate-coverage-643` is now queued as #1241
  at `7d9b34c6` with 15 docs-generator tests, `tools/docs_generate.py check`,
  focused 100% coverage for `tools/docs_generate.py`, and diff checks green.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-mkdocs-hooks-coverage-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `900faf7b` against `origin/main` at `ef430385`; direct hook unittest
  passed 10 tests and diff checks are clean. Local coverage/pytest variants
  are blocked only because this machine lacks `coverage.py >= 7.10` and
  `pytest`; earlier focused coverage for this tranche reported 100% for
  `tools/mkdocs_hooks.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-merge-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `29cb5a51` with 17 total tests and 100% target coverage for
  `tools/scripts/merge_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-lcov-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `e931e469` with 19 total tests and 100% target coverage for
  `tools/scripts/lcov_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-app-framework-edges-493` was rebased
  cleanly again to `f5a44955` after #1237 merged. The earlier target
  validation remains recorded below, but this latest head was not
  revalidated because both `build/` and `build-cov/` had been removed from
  the worktree; rerun the focused app-framework build before queueing.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-asset-manager-coverage-493` remains
  useful after #1125 and refreshed cleanly at `9bd0fea1` against
  `origin/main` at `f6e092ba`. It adds file-backed shader/blob cache and
  cached `@2x` image behavior coverage; `pulp-test-asset-manager` passed 75
  assertions in 29 test cases, matching CTest passed 24/24, and diff checks
  are clean.
- Local-only audit: `pulp-phase3-table-model-edges-493` rebased to
  `origin/main` with no remaining diff; the tranche is already absorbed
  upstream via earlier table-model work and should not be queued again.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-audit-top-level-coverage-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `339b79c8` with 9 tests and 100% target coverage for
  `tools/audit.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-resolve-runs-on-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `42f24313` with 18 base tests plus 2 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/resolve_runs_on.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-lcov-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `6ec8d60e` with 8 base tests plus 11 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/lcov_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-merge-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `f40c0485` with 14 base tests plus 3 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/merge_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-cmajor-external-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `89f10266` with 4 base tests plus 9 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/cmajor_external.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-skill-sync-extra-643` refreshed cleanly at
  `0631b22d` with 4 base tests plus 20 extra tests, 39 gate tests, and
  100% target coverage for `tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-freshness-extra-643` refreshed cleanly at
  `1f0507eb` with 9 extra tests, 23 combined package validation tests,
  and 100% target coverage for `tools/packages/freshness_check.py` when
  run with direct focused coverage over the package tests.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-validate-registry-extra-643` refreshed
  cleanly at `619560ed` with 8 extra tests, non-strict registry
  validation, and 100% target coverage for `tools/packages/validate_registry.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-coverage-tier-check-extra-643` is now
  absorbed upstream; rebase skipped the old local commit and left no diff,
  so do not reopen it.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-ruleset-drift-config-643` refreshed again on
  2026-05-05 at `145cd195`; it remains a static guard/test-file-only
  tranche with no measured source surface in the focused Python coverage
  runner.
- Codecov dashboard watch: recent rapid main merges cancelled most older
  main-branch `Coverage` push runs. The main coverage run for #1213
  completed successfully at `ea03a328ef33`; #1214's merge should start
  the next main coverage push run for `e1ef40807145`.
- Just merged: #1117, #1204, #1199, #1194, #1125, #1116, #1113, #1104,
  #1097, #1088, #1203, #1115, #1195, #1083, #1096, #1200, #1205, #1078,
  #1196, #1197, #1198, #1202, and #1201 after required
  `linux`/`macos`/`windows` wrappers and Codecov patch gates were green.
- Active triage: none for #1202; it merged after the fake `amixer` PATH
  fix `b9e086fa` cleared the Namespace lanes. Refill from the local-ready
  queue while main post-merge jobs run.
- Retarget investigation: `shipyard cloud retarget` can plan a
  Namespace/GitHub-hosted lane move, but `--apply` failed while trying
  to cancel the old job. `gh` already has `workflow` scope and Shipyard
  doctor reports cloud auth ready; the job-level cancel endpoint returned
  GitHub 404. A fallback `workflow_dispatch` did not replace the stale
  queued PR-event check in the PR rollup for #1078. Filed Shipyard #265
  to make this recovery path explicit.
- Queue cleanup: cancelled duplicate active/queued `workflow_dispatch`
  build runs `25222305579`, `25216296162`, `25216004212`, and
  `25215881987` because they do not satisfy the current PR-event branch
  protection contexts and were consuming runner capacity.
- Refill: opened #1205 from `local/phase3-bench-diff-coverage-643`,
  branch `feature/bench-diff-coverage-643`, head `6a190c5b7f45`.
  Applied `codecov`, linked #641/#643, and dispatched Namespace run
  `25222999092`. Merged as `7ad9308f6cc1f62d971f89e782d8887b40153953`

  PR-event Build and Coverage workflows are running. Local validation
  previously reported 13 passing docs-generate tests, `docs_generate.py
  check` passing, and 97% target coverage. Merged as
  `4d45182c7800ac61594db1cc48625b8129882751` after required gates were
  green; no leftover branch runs were active after merge.
- Refill: opened #1209 from `local/phase3-mkdocs-hooks-coverage-643`,
  branch `feature/mkdocs-hooks-coverage-643`, head `9e2f898db95c`.
  Applied `codecov`, linked #641/#643, and fresh PR-event Build and
  Coverage workflows are running. Local validation was rerun with

- Operating mode: keep polling, merge PRs as soon as required
  `linux`/`macos`/`windows` wrappers are green, cancel leftover advisory
  PR-head runs after merge, and only refill when the active queue drains
  or a high-confidence local tranche is already validated.

## Cancellation Result

- Cancellation pass completed on 2026-04-30 EDT.
- Cancellation requests submitted successfully for all 193 recorded runs.
- A few runs completed while cancellation was in flight; sticky queued
  runs for #1133 and #1134 required a second cancellation request.
- Final verification after GitHub settled: 0 queued or in-progress
  workflow runs remained for the open `codecov` PR branches in this
  snapshot.
- Expected side effect: cancelled validation attempts may leave PRs
  `BLOCKED` or `UNSTABLE` until the queue is reopened and fresh
  validation runs are dispatched.

## Resume Batches

### 2026-05-01 Batch 1: Build Gate Refill

Namespace capacity check showed no queued or in-progress GitHub workflow
runs for `danielraffel/pulp`, so the first refill batch replaced only the
cancelled `Build and Test` gates for recent Codecov PRs. Existing passing
Codecov/version/docs/license results were left intact.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `bf87273e0534` | Build and Test | `25202620106` | in progress |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `2d2c119b4c8d` | Build and Test | `25202620128` | in progress |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `cb6fb9c4e9c3` | Build and Test | `25202620088` | in progress |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `2b2ccde36e63` | Build and Test | `25202620280` | in progress |

Next refill rule: when this batch drops below four active Codecov build
runs, dispatch the next merge-ready paused PRs by pinned SHA and update
this table before adding more local-only tranche PRs.

Follow-up correction: these `workflow_dispatch` runs all passed, but they
did not satisfy branch protection because stale failed or cancelled
`pull_request` check runs with the same required context names remained on
the PR head commits. The branches were then refreshed against `main` with
`gh pr update-branch` to create merge-eligible PR-event check suites:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `f48a49e62ec3` | `25203370720` | `25203370713` | pending |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `bccfec4797d5` | `25203371862` | `25203371864` | pending |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `45dbdda453a3` | `25203373031` | `25203372990` | pending |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `14098f98d57e` | `25203374251` | `25203374250` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 2: Build Gate Refill

The first batch assigned cleanly on Namespace with no GitHub queued-run
backlog, so a second four-PR batch was queued behind it. This keeps the
active window warm without re-dispatching the full paused set.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `46854e04fcf2` | Build and Test | `25202718222` | queued |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `5149c107a3ac` | Build and Test | `25202718230` | queued |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `6fea2fa4686a` | Build and Test | `25202718329` | queued |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `a6237254b05d` | Build and Test | `25202718395` | queued |

Note: `shipyard cloud run build` printed older saved run IDs for #1136
and #1137, but `gh run list` confirmed the fresh workflow_dispatch run
IDs above.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 3: Build Gate Refill

A third build-only batch was queued after #1136-#1139. #1131 was not
queued because its `Diff coverage required` check is red and needs
coverage-gate triage before a build-only re-run can make it mergeable.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `2695097458c4` | Build and Test | `25202770455` | queued |
| #1133 | `feature/audio-channel-set-coverage-640-next` | `df227394cd7e` | Build and Test | `25202770462` | queued |
| #1134 | `codex/coverage-phase3-tranche-20260430095455` | `1dbd12f64ba0` | Build and Test | `25202770509` | queued |
| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `89242ca0bfa5` | Build and Test | `25202770726` | queued |

Held for triage: #1131 `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next`
has passing `codecov/patch` but failing `Diff coverage required`, so it
likely needs a coverage workflow re-run or a patch rather than build-only
refill.

Follow-up correction: because build-only dispatches do not clear stale
PR-event contexts, the queued or running build-only dispatches for
#1132-#1139 were cancelled after the #1140-#1143 branch-refresh batch
started. Cancelled workflow_dispatch run IDs: `25202718222`,
`25202718230`, `25202718329`, `25202718395`, `25202770455`,
`25202770462`, `25202770509`, and `25202770726`.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 4: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After confirming the build-only dispatches were not merge-eligible
evidence, the next refill batch used `gh pr update-branch` so GitHub
created fresh required `pull_request` checks.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `bc32ea5904b6` | `25203513486` | `25203513496` | pending |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `476677d7b926` | `25203494171` | `25203494182` | pending |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `cc7fcaf98be8` | `25203494454` | `25203494423` | pending |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `72fa08f3553a` | `25203493849` | `25203493834` | pending |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `df3f376fa716` | `25203493795` | `25203493796` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 5: PR-Event Branch Refresh

Namespace still had the earlier PR-event batch queued but not failing, so
the next low-risk stale build-matrix PRs were refreshed in a small batch.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1129 | `feature/midi-sysex-accumulator-coverage-645-next` | `a5ae96aa067c` | `25203575118` | `25203575127` | pending |
| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `8b403641dfd4` | `25203575435` | `25203575450` | pending |
| #1133 | `feature/audio-channel-set-coverage-640-next` | `a82513bedc13` | `25203575337` | `25203575346` | pending |
| #1134 | `codex/coverage-phase3-tranche-20260430095455` | `8c91ac2d0315` | `25203575338` | `25203575315` | pending |

Follow-up refresh after `main` advanced through #1141 and #1131:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `539bbb76c41a` | `25204395492` | `25204395482` | pending; fresh PR-event checks queued with sanitizer run `25204395501` and IWYU run `25204395484` |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 6: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After #1139 merged and GitHub Actions pressure dropped to 18 active
runs, the next four patched/stale Codecov PRs were refreshed with
`gh pr update-branch` so branch protection gets fresh `pull_request`
contexts. Pressure after dispatch rose to 39 active runs, with 24 queued
and 13 in progress, so hold further refill until this batch drains.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Sanitizer Run | IWYU Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1051 | `feature/signal-poly-math-coverage-645` | `0675a09ecabd` | `25207650057` | `25207650060` | `25207650064` | `25207650080` | merged as `8f038e9b8150`; queued advisory sanitizer run cancellation requested after merge |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 7: One-PR Refill

After stale duplicate workflow-dispatch and already-merged PR runs were
cancelled, only current PR-event work plus main advisory push workflows
remained in the queue. A single stale PR was refreshed to avoid flooding
Namespace while #1190, #1191, and #1188 continue draining.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Sanitizer Run | IWYU Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1128 | `feature/audio-workgroup-coverage-640-next` | `494233c87fe0` | `25212496127` | `25212496120` | `25212496122` | `25212496131` | merged as `ebc118d95684`; queued coverage/sanitizer run cancellations requested after merge |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 8: One-PR Refill

#1127 had no active runs and only stale cancelled/failed contexts from an
older base, so it was refreshed with `gh pr update-branch`. Hold further
cloud refill while #1127, #1128, #1191, and #1188 drain.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Sanitizer Run | IWYU Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1127 | `feature/render-texture-atlas-coverage-646-next` | `310074265e45` | `25213360729` | `25213360744` | `25213360732` | `25213360752` | merged as `8ccc4a151d4e`; queued advisory sanitizer run cancellation requested after merge |

## Merge Waves While Queue Is In Flight

These PRs were already green/mergeable when the paused queue was
reopened, so they were squash-merged without consuming additional
Namespace capacity. #1099 became conflicted after the preceding view
coverage merges and is held for a branch refresh.

## Conflict And Failure Triage

| PR | Branch | New Head | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1099 | `feature/view-layout-widgets-coverage-493` | `66decf5958e8` | Merged as `a18291ee6642` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers passed; advisory lanes were still pending. |
| #1084 | `feature/runtime-text-diff-coverage-641` | `cb63e51416ed` | Merged as `66c74123430a` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers passed; advisory macOS sanitizer lanes were still pending. |
| #1089 | `feature/view-file-browser-coverage-493` | `86cbe4ca12e9` | Conflict resolved, pushed, and later merged as `d214d24ec20b` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers, Namespace platform checks, Codecov patch, diff coverage, coverage lanes, and sanitizer lanes were green. |
| #1131 | `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next` | `f5af90f4f5af` | Pushed coverage-harness fix for Windows `.exe` object discovery in `scripts/run_coverage.sh`; `bash -n`, `test_run_coverage.py`, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check` passed. Local CMake validation was not rerun after the harness patch because the laptop filesystem had only about 150-211 MiB free; the earlier excerpt binary validation was already green and the platform-sensitive coverage fix now needs CI/Namespace. |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `e4ea28dfc2e0` | Pushed a test isolation fix after macOS Namespace exposed a parallel CTest temp-dir collision in `test_cli_projects_registry.cpp`. Focused local `pulp-test-cli-projects-registry "add_project falls back to directory basename when no name hint"` passed; skill-sync/version-bump reports and `git diff --check` passed. Merged as `ea731cbf365c` after required wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff coverage passed; advisory macOS sanitizer lanes were still pending. |
| #1079 | `feature/volume-detector-coverage-642` | `5efc687e53a0` | Conflict resolved after #1045 landed overlapping service-discovery coverage. Kept the non-duplicated lifecycle coverage from #1079, dropped the now-duplicated backend registration failure test, validated `pulp-test-network-service-discovery`, focused `[issue-642]`, broad `NSD|MountedVolumeListChangeDetector|LockingAsyncUpdater` CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then force-with-lease pushed. Merged as `da004f90e21c` after required wrappers, Namespace platform checks, Codecov patch, diff coverage, and coverage lanes were green. |
| #1202 | `feature/system-volume-coverage-640` | `b9e086fa7dfb` | Linux Namespace exposed that the fake `amixer` PATH hid normal shell tools used by the production pipeline. Patched the test to prepend the fake bin directory, not replace `PATH`; local `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-system-volume -j4`, direct test binary, focused CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check` passed. #1202 merged as `00b0871a6dea89fecb14d4aca8502e5c52507416`. |
| Shipyard #265 | `shipyard cloud retarget` | n/a | Filed `cloud retarget: support useful fallback when job cancellation is denied` after #1078 showed that retarget could identify the queued macOS lane, but apply failed while calling the job-level cancel endpoint. Follow-up evidence showed `gh` already has `workflow` scope and the endpoint returns GitHub 404, so the issue is likely unsupported job-level cancellation rather than only token scope. A plain GitHub-hosted `workflow_dispatch` started a new run but did not replace the stale queued PR-event check in the PR rollup. |

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 02:12 EDT

- Merge-now set: none.
- Watch first: #1123, #1099, #1132, #1142, #1143. These are mergeable at
  the Git level, have no real failing checks, and are waiting on the
  underlying Namespace/build or coverage legs before the lower-case
  required aliases can go green.
- #1075 was the only fresh actionable gate failure in this sweep
  (`Enforce version & skill sync` after the coverage workflow patch);
  it was fixed with metadata-only head `4469868e669b`.
- Older PRs with red lower-case `linux`/`macos`/`windows` contexts mostly
  reflect the deliberate queue-cancellation pause and need future
  PR-event branch refreshes in small batches, not immediate code patches.
- Queue pressure at the audit: roughly 72 active Codecov-like workflow
  runs across 25 branches, so do not refill Namespace until the current
  batch drains.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 02:55 EDT

- Open `codecov` PRs: 44.
- Merge-now set: none. All open Codecov PRs currently report
  `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED`.
- GitHub Actions pressure: 60 queued workflow runs and 4 in progress for
  `danielraffel/pulp`, so do not add another PR-event refresh batch yet.
- Watch first: #1143, #1142, #1139, #1137, #1140. #1143 has Linux,
  Windows, diff coverage, Codecov patch, and advisory coverage/sanitizer
  lanes green, but its required `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]` build wrapper
  is still queued. #1142 is similarly waiting on macOS build and macOS
  coverage. #1139/#1137 are still waiting on macOS Namespace lanes, with
  #1137 also waiting on the Linux build wrapper.
- Local-only progress continues while the queue drains. Workers were
  assigned to refresh `local/phase3-merge-cobertura-extra-643`,
  `local/phase3-lcov-cobertura-extra-643`, and
  `local/phase3-run-python-coverage-extra-643` against current
  `origin/main`; no push, PR, or Namespace dispatch until capacity returns.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 03:17 EDT

- Open `codecov` PRs: 43 after #1120 merged.
- Merge-now set: none. A fresh merge-candidate query returned no
  `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` open Codecov PRs.
- GitHub Actions pressure remained high at 58 queued and 5 in progress,
  so no additional PR-event refresh batch was added.
- #1143 remained blocked only on the queued `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`
  build job. A dry-run `shipyard cloud retarget --pr 1143 --target macOS
  --provider github-hosted --workflow build` showed a clean single-job
  retarget plan, but `--apply` could not cancel the queued job because
  the current `gh` token lacks `actions:write`. Leave the existing
  Namespace lane intact unless a human cancels it manually.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 03:33 EDT

- #1138 merged as `44cff0532848`; tracker comments posted to #641 and
  #493.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 40 after #1138 merged.
- Merge-now set: none. A fresh merge-candidate query returned no
  `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` open Codecov PRs.
- GitHub Actions pressure after the small refill batch: 50 active
  Codecov-like workflow runs, with 45 queued and 5 in progress.
- Watch first: #1143 and #1142 are still blocked on old queued macOS
  Namespace jobs. Keep those existing useful runs rather than pushing
  branch-refresh noise that would invalidate already-green lanes.
- Refill batch added because pressure had dropped below the earlier
  58-72 queued range:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Sanitizer Run | IWYU Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 03:38 EDT

- #1082 merged as `b0903cd8ed4b` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and the relevant platform build
  lanes were green. Advisory macOS sanitizer/coverage jobs were still
  queued at merge time.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #646.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 39 immediately after the merge; fresh
  merge-candidate poll returned none.
- Subsequent queue poll: 57 active Codecov-like workflow runs, with 51
  queued and 6 in progress. Do not add another Namespace/PR-event refill
  batch yet; continue local-only prep and merge monitoring.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 03:56 EDT

- #1135 merged as `44e67d52cbfc` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff coverage were green.
  Advisory macOS sanitizer jobs were still queued at merge time.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #645.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 38 immediately after the merge.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 04:08 EDT

- #1139 merged as `d701d4ae8d45` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Namespace build lanes, and Codecov patch were
  green. Pending macOS coverage and sanitizer jobs were advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #642.
- Queue pressure immediately before the merge was 18 active GitHub
  workflow runs, with 17 queued and 1 in progress, so capacity is low
  enough for another small refill batch rather than a full queue dump.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 04:30 EDT

- #1134 merged as `a01ca7410faa` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, coverage lanes,
  and sanitizer lanes were green.
- #1119 merged as `0bf8f64aeb8b` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. Pending macOS
  coverage was advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 for both merges and to #645 for #1134.

### Merge And Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:12 EDT

- #1137 merged as `ea731cbf365c` from `UNSTABLE` after required
  `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff
  coverage were green. Pending macOS ASan/UBSan jobs were advisory.
  Tracker comments were posted to #641 and #640.
- #1184 opened from the previously local memory-message-channel tranche
  as `feature/memory-message-channel-coverage-641` at
  `065ef90edbd3`. It was labeled `codecov`; PR-event checks are queued
  and explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209211899` was started with
  `shipyard cloud run build feature/memory-message-channel-coverage-641
  --provider namespace --require-sha HEAD --no-wait`.
- #1185 opened from the previously local binding tranche as
  `feature/state-binding-coverage-641` at `c1e5bd595244`. It was
  rebased onto `origin/main`, revalidated locally with
  `pulp-test-binding`, focused `Binding` CTest, skill-sync report,
  version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled `codecov`.
  Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209337122` is queued/running.
- The first #1184 `shipyard pr` attempt used the unskipped local target
  config and stopped before PR creation when SSH Windows timed out. The
  retry used the documented Namespace-first pattern:
  `shipyard pr --skip-target mac --skip-target ubuntu --skip-target
  windows`, followed by the explicit Namespace dispatch above.

### Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:21 EDT

- #1186 opened from the text-layout worker tranche as
  `feature/canvas-text-layout-coverage-641` at `d4d40aa77928`. It was
  rechecked locally with `pulp-test-text-shaper`, focused text-shaper
  CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`,
  then labeled `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch
  `25209419094` is queued/running.
- #1187 opened from the SVG worker tranche as
  `feature/canvas-svg-coverage-641` at `7e4e8c5fabdd`. It was rechecked
  locally with `pulp-test-svg`, exact `^SvgImage ` CTest, skill-sync
  report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled
  `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209443645` is
  queued/running.
- AssetManager worker output is held local-only because #1125 is already
  open on `feature/view-asset-manager-coverage-493-next` for the same
  surface.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:23 EDT

- #1143 merged as `d36fddc2cd9f` after required `linux`, `macos`, and

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:27 EDT

- #1075 merged as `c34f11f7138c` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. The red Windows
  coverage job was advisory artifact-upload plumbing: coverage suite,
  Cobertura existence check, and Codecov upload succeeded; only the
  Cobertura artifact upload step failed.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #643.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:33 EDT

- #1133 merged as `e1a22a1ffd93` after required `linux`, `macos`, and

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:55 EDT

- #1086 merged as `0300ba207577` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. Windows/Linux
  coverage and platform build lanes were green; pending macOS coverage
  and macOS sanitizer jobs were advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #640.
- Generated `build*` directories were removed from completed sibling
  coverage worktrees only, recovering local free disk from roughly
  248 MiB to roughly 3.7 GiB. Source worktrees and branches were left
  intact.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 06:01 EDT

- #1074 merged as `5898bf057163` after required `linux`, `macos`, and

  platform build lanes were green. Pending macOS sanitizer jobs were
  advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #640.

### Refill Update 2026-05-01 06:10 EDT

- #1190 opened from the path-to-SDF tranche as
  `feature/path-to-sdf-coverage-641` at `c4b62563589a`. It was already
  refreshed against current `origin/main`, revalidated locally with
  `pulp-test-path-to-sdf`, focused `path_to_sdf` CTest, skill-sync
  report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled
  `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25210687152` is
  queued/running.
- Follow-up: the first Windows Namespace run exposed a pre-existing
  `pulp-test-hot-reload` watcher timing issue under parallel CTest, so
  #1190 was rebased onto `origin/main` at `7b78de80` and pushed at
  `69aa03601cb8` with deterministic hot-reload temp paths/content waits
  plus a CTest resource lock. Local validation passed
  `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-hot-reload -j4`,
  `./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload "[view][hotreload]"`, focused
  `HotReloader` CTest, `pulp-test-path-to-sdf`, focused `path_to_sdf`
  CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`.
  Fresh PR-event checks are queued under Build and Test run
  `25211537622`.
- Tracker comment posted to #641.

## Real Diff-Gap Patch Queue

These PRs were inspected after the pause. The failures are not just stale
branch-protection checks; the repo diff-coverage gate reported concrete
uncovered changed lines. Assigned items have workers patching their own
branches in separate worktrees.

Local disk note: after completed Codecov worktrees pushed their fixes, their
generated `build/` directories plus stale generated build outputs from
older Codecov worktrees were removed. Source worktrees and branches were
left intact. Free space recovered from about `192 MiB` to about `4.7 GiB`.

  - #1078 `feature/runtime-gzip-header-coverage-641` -> `3a93e12603f8`.
- Fresh PR rollups show all six active with no current failed checks.
  Repository active-run count was about `85`; stop blind refilling here and
  switch to watch/fix/merge until capacity drains.
- #1072 was intentionally not refreshed because it already had active queued
  macOS checks.

## Local-Only Work Prepared During Pause

This table started as the local-only tranche queue prepared after the
Namespace pause began. Many rows now record the later PR / merge
outcome; rows marked queued or held are the ones that still need action
after capacity returns.

May 14 reconciliation note: some older rows below still preserve their
original pause-time validation text. The readiness sweep and snapshot
summary above are the current override for already-landed work; in
particular #1269, #1271, #1273, #1274, #1280, #1282, #1283, #1285,
#1286, and #1287 are now historical because their coverage commits are
on `origin/main`.

## Resume Checklist

1. Confirm Namespace capacity is available.
2. Re-fetch each PR branch and verify the remote branch still points to the recorded head SHA.
3. Re-dispatch in small batches, starting with the most merge-ready PRs.
4. After each batch, merge only PRs with required checks green and `mergeStateStatus` clean enough for normal merge.
5. Update this ledger with resumed run IDs and merge SHAs.

2026-05-15 03:24 PDT: repaired PR #2017
`feature/phase3-view-widget-batch-493` after GitHub-hosted macOS ARM64
timed out in the shellout test `pulp doctor android|ios are recognized
subcommands`. The real macOS job failed on test #67 after 120.17s; the
`macos` alias failed because it mirrored that platform failure. Commit
`6e46f56` changes that parser-recognition test to run
`pulp doctor android --versions` and `pulp doctor ios --versions`, which
still proves the mobile subcommands are accepted before the diagnostic
short-circuit but avoids slow Android/iOS host SDK probes on saturated CI
runners. Local validation on the PR branch passed: `cmake --build build

targets with 16 new focused CTest cases across identity parsing, stream
result/file-position behavior, i18n duplicate/trailing parser paths,
analytics JSON escaping and empty flush, memory-mapped file read-write

copy/move/hex/bit-count helpers, and license activation malformed-URL
paths. It also includes two bounded correctness fixes exposed by the new

dashes instead of decoding them as zero nibbles, and
`FileAnalyticsDestination` now escapes JSON string output for quotes,
backslashes, and common control characters. Local macOS validation

after the GitHub queue spike. PRs #2012, #2014, #2016, #2022, #2030,
and #2031 showed failed alias or sanitizer/coverage checks, but the
inspected runs were cancellations clustered around 2026-05-15 10:36 UTC,
not actionable test failures. Examples: #2030 and #2031 macOS,
sanitizer, and macOS coverage legs were cancelled while Windows/Linux
legs succeeded; #2012 ASan/UBSan were cancelled while TSan succeeded;
#2016 Android coverage was cancelled while macOS/Windows/Linux coverage
legs succeeded; #2022 macOS, Android macOS build, and ASan/UBSan were
cancelled while Linux/Windows and TSan succeeded. Current action: do not
patch code for these cancellation-only failures; selectively rerun failed
jobs later when the queue calms, and avoid pushing small new CI batches.

2026-05-15 04:45 PDT: collapsed the codecov queue from 25 small
GitHub-hosted test PRs into 4 broader replacement PRs to reduce slow
macOS runner fan-out. Before opening replacements, cancelled queued /
in-progress runs for the superseded branches where possible, merged each
source branch into a domain worktree, resolved conflicts, and ran local
macOS validation with `PULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF` and examples off. No
Namespace CI or SSH hosts were used.

Replacement PRs:
- #2048 `feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-platform-consolidated-657`
  supersedes #2025, #2026, #2030, #2031, #2032, #2033, #2040, plus the
  held local runtime helper batch #656. Local validation built affected
  runtime/platform/event/state targets and directly ran
  `pulp-test-analytics`, `pulp-test-crypto`, `pulp-test-environment`,
  `pulp-test-events-async-helpers`, `pulp-test-i18n`,
  `pulp-test-identity`, `pulp-test-ipc-endpoints`,
  `pulp-test-json-rpc`, `pulp-test-license`,
  `pulp-test-memory-message-channel`,
  `pulp-test-network-service-discovery`, `pulp-test-permissions`,
  `pulp-test-platform`, `pulp-test-properties`, `pulp-test-runtime`,
  `pulp-test-runtime-utils`, `pulp-test-state-tree`,
  `pulp-test-stream`, and `pulp-test-xml-zip`; all passed. Consolidation
  exposed malformed string literals in `test_i18n.cpp` and
  `test_license.cpp`; fixed in follow-up commits on the replacement
  branch before push.
- #2049 `feature/phase3-codecov-media-consolidated-658` supersedes
  #2012, #2014, #2019, #2028, #2034, #2041. Local validation built and
  directly ran affected audio/MIDI/signal/canvas/OSC/SDF binaries:
  `pulp-test-attributed-string`, `pulp-test-audio-file`,
  `pulp-test-descriptor-validation`, `pulp-test-diagnostic`,
  `pulp-test-dirty-tracker`, `pulp-test-dsp-expansion`,
  `pulp-test-midi-buffer-ump`, `pulp-test-midi-ci`,
  `pulp-test-midi-file`, `pulp-test-mpe-buffer`,
  `pulp-test-msdf-atlas`, `pulp-test-osc`, `pulp-test-osc-bundle`,
  `pulp-test-path-to-sdf`, `pulp-test-psdf-atlas`,
  `pulp-test-scan-blacklist`, `pulp-test-sdf-atlas`,
  `pulp-test-sdf-atlas-cache`, `pulp-test-sdf-effects`,
  `pulp-test-sdf-software-renderer`, `pulp-test-sdf-text`, and
  `pulp-test-signal`; all passed.
- #2051 `feature/phase3-codecov-tools-host-format-consolidated-659`
  supersedes #2016, #2022, #2024, #2035, #2037, #2038. Local validation
  built and directly ran affected tools/host/format/state binaries:
  `pulp-test-audio-tools`, `pulp-test-binding`,
  `pulp-test-child-process`, `pulp-test-cli-fetchcontent-cache`,
  `pulp-test-cli-shellout`, `pulp-test-descriptor-validation`,
  `pulp-test-environment`, `pulp-test-graph-serializer`,
  `pulp-test-headless`, `pulp-test-host`, `pulp-test-ios-audio-session`,
  `pulp-test-plugin-state-io`, `pulp-test-preset-manager`,
  `pulp-test-sdl3-surface`, `pulp-test-state`,
  `pulp-test-validation-harness`, `pulp-test-aax-model`, and
  `pulp-test-ara`; all passed. Python tests first failed under
  `python3 -m pytest` because this local Python 3.14 lacks pytest, then
  passed through their checked-in unittest entrypoints:
  `tools/packages/test_freshness_check_extra.py`,
  `tools/scripts/test_auto_release_decision_extra.py`,
  `tools/scripts/test_check_format_validation.py`,
  `tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release_extra.py`,
  `tools/scripts/test_host_pump_lint.py`,
  `tools/scripts/test_macos_reroute_watcher.py`, and
  `tools/scripts/test_ruleset_drift_config.py`.
- #2050 `feature/phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660` supersedes
  #2017, #2042, #2043, #2044, #2045, #2046. Local validation built and
  directly ran affected view/UI/theme/widget binaries:
  `pulp-test-accessibility-tree`, `pulp-test-appearance`,
  `pulp-test-asset-manager`, `pulp-test-audio-bridge`,
  `pulp-test-auto-ui`, `pulp-test-cli-shellout`,
  `pulp-test-code-editor`, `pulp-test-file-browser`,
  `pulp-test-graph-editor-view`, `pulp-test-gui-components`,
  `pulp-test-image-cache`, `pulp-test-input-events`, `pulp-test-modal`,
  `pulp-test-param-attachment`, `pulp-test-phase9-widgets`,
  `pulp-test-preset-browser`, `pulp-test-property-list`,
  `pulp-test-table-list-box`, `pulp-test-theme`,
  `pulp-test-theme-contrast`, `pulp-test-theme-presets`,
  `pulp-test-tree-view`, `pulp-test-ui-components`,
  `pulp-test-visualization`, `pulp-test-waveform-editor`,
  `pulp-test-widgets`, and `pulp-test-window-manager`; all passed.

All superseded PRs were commented and closed after replacements existed;
source branches were intentionally retained for audit. Pre-push
diff-cover on #2048, #2050, and #2051 attempted a separate coverage
configure and hit a local transient Highway FetchContent checkout error
(`failed to checkout tag 457c891...`), then was demoted by
`PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; focused local macOS validation was
green before push.

Updated batching policy for remaining codecov work: hold future
coverage slices locally until there is a substantial domain corpus, then
submit one broad PR per related area instead of small PR fan-out. Target
roughly a dozen discrete slices per PR when practical, validate locally
on macOS, push only GitHub-hosted CI, avoid Namespace, and record both
the held local queue and any submitted replacement PR mapping here.

2026-05-15 05:25 PDT: started the next held local batch under the updated
large-PR policy. Worktree:
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`, now rebased to commit
`eb68a2b68` (`test(ship): cover package cli failure paths`) on current
`origin/main` after the initial `342260bf1` ship/package edge commit.
This branch has not been
pushed and has no PR yet. Scope: ship/package coverage for appcast XML
fallbacks and parsing edges, Android SDK/tool discovery and package
failure branches, NSIS installer script generation branches, and
codesign/notarization/pkg failure paths. Also includes adjacent release
package CLI coverage for rpath handling, binary staging, and archive
packaging branches, missing binary / missing WGPU hard-fail behavior,
Windows ZIP packaging with the `pulp-cpp` delegate, Linux rpath rewrites
for both shipped binaries, plus Skia release-fetch manifest and archive
layout coverage. Local macOS validation:
configured with `-DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF -DPULP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF`, built
`pulp-test-appcast`, `pulp-test-android-package`,
`pulp-test-nsis-installer`, and `pulp-test-codesign`, then directly ran
all four binaries. Passing totals: appcast 89 assertions / 16 cases,
Android package 129 assertions / 18 cases, NSIS installer 57 assertions /
19 cases, codesign 19 assertions / 10 cases. Python release packaging
validation also passed through unittest entrypoints after the rebase:
`tools/scripts/test_package_cli.py` (13 tests),
`tools/scripts/test_package_cli_extra.py` (15 tests after adding four
new package CLI edge cases), and `tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release.py`
(14 tests). `git diff --check` passed before the new local commit.
Resume action: keep holding this branch locally and continue
adding coherent ship/package or adjacent release coverage until it is
large enough to justify one GitHub-hosted CI run, then push as a single
batched PR.

2026-05-15 10:45 PDT: resumed monitoring/fix pass on the four
consolidated GitHub-hosted codecov PRs with the policy that failures are
actionable unless logs prove stale/external infrastructure. No Namespace
or SSH validation was dispatched. Findings and actions:

- #2048 (`feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-platform-consolidated-657`) had
  a real required diff-coverage miss in `analytics.cpp` JSON escaping and
  `identity.cpp` UUID dash validation. Added focused runtime tests in
  `test/test_analytics.cpp` and `test/test_identity.cpp`, committed
  `865242368` (`test(runtime): cover consolidated branch edges`), and
  locally validated `pulp-test-analytics` plus `pulp-test-identity`
  focused and full binary runs. Push required demoting the local pre-push
  diff-cover gate because the separate coverage configure hit the local
  Highway FetchContent checkout error (`failed to checkout tag
  457c891...`); GitHub-hosted checks remain authoritative and are running
  on the fresh SHA.
- #2050 (`feature/phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660`) had a real
  Windows failure in `AssetManager font file loading derives family names
  and uses cache`: the production code derived the font family by splitting
  only on `/`, so Windows paths produced the full temporary path as the
  family name. Fixed the root cause in `core/view/src/asset_manager.cpp`
  by deriving the stem through `std::filesystem::path`, added focused view
  boundary tests in `test/test_preset_browser.cpp` and
  `test/test_table_list_box.cpp`, committed `4ed92c718`
  (`fix(view): derive font family with platform paths`), and locally
  validated the affected focused/full test binaries plus the previously
  failing CLI project-bump case. Fresh GitHub-hosted checks are running on
  the updated SHA.
- #2049 and #2051 still showed external `codecov/patch` failures, but
  current PR file lists do not include the previously reported
  `core/canvas/src/svg.cpp` diff. The relevant GitHub Coverage workflows
  were green on their current heads, so reran Coverage for #2049
  (`25914516624`) and #2051 (`25914516918`) to force Codecov to recompute
  against the actual current diffs rather than patching unrelated SVG code.
- #2051 Build and Test had a macOS failure in the runner dependency
  checkout path (`Could not resolve host: github.com` while cloning
  `google/highway.git`), not test code. Reran failed jobs for
  `25914516941`; if the rerun exposes a deterministic test/build failure,
  fix the branch rather than rerunning again blindly.

Resume action: keep monitoring #2048, #2049, #2050, and #2051. Merge only
after required GitHub checks and Codecov are green. If a rerun produces a
new deterministic failure, inspect logs and patch the root cause on the
owning consolidated branch.

2026-05-15 11:20 PDT: swept all currently open `codecov` PRs. There are
four: #2048, #2049, #2050, and #2051. No non-bot review/issue comments
needed action on #2048, #2049, or #2050. #2051 had two actionable Codex
review comments against `core/host/src/graph_serializer.cpp`: preserve the
serialized display name for unresolved plugin nodes, and avoid a second
`PluginSlot::load()` after deserialization already observed a load failure.
Patched #2051 in commit `6fc610acd` (`fix(host): preserve unresolved graph
plugin labels`) by adding an explicit unresolved-plugin node path in
`SignalGraph`, switching `GraphSerializer::from_json()` to use it, and
adding a focused graph serializer regression test. Local validation passed:
built `pulp-test-graph-serializer`, ran focused unresolved-plugin display
name and identity tests, then ran the full graph serializer binary (394
assertions / 17 cases). Pushed the branch and commented on #2051 with the
validation summary. Fresh GitHub-hosted CI is running for the updated head.

2026-05-15 11:38 PDT: #2048's fresh required diff-coverage job completed
red at 72% with concrete misses in `core/runtime/src/analytics.cpp` lines
14-18 and `core/runtime/src/identity.cpp` lines 47-48. Root cause on the
identity side was a test-input bug: the prior misplaced-dash examples were
not exactly 36 characters, so they exercised the length guard rather than
the dashed-format guard. Added commit `8ec1b311f`
(`test(runtime): cover remaining coverage gate branches`) with an exact
36-character malformed dashed UUID and additional per-character analytics
JSON escape cases for backslash, quote, newline, carriage return, and tab
in event names plus property keys/values. Local validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-analytics pulp-test-identity`,
focused analytics escape tests (19 assertions / 3 cases), focused UUID
round-trip test (19 assertions / 1 case), full `pulp-test-analytics` (49
assertions / 17 cases), full `pulp-test-identity` (51 assertions / 8
cases), and `git diff --check`. Pushed #2048; fresh GitHub-hosted checks
are running.

2026-05-15 11:40 PDT: continued the held local release/package batch
`feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661` after rebasing onto current
`origin/main`. Added commit `cf4001cea`
(`test(release): guard dual cli packaging workflow`) to extend
`tools/scripts/test_release_workflow_test_step.py` with static regression
coverage for the release CLI workflow's dual-binary contract: Unix and
Windows package steps must pass `--cpp-binary`, and Unix/Windows smoke
steps must exercise both `pulp` and `pulp-cpp` while checking loader/DLL
failure text. Local validation passed
`python3 tools/scripts/test_release_workflow_test_step.py` (9 tests) and
`git diff --check`. This batch remains local-only; no PR/CI dispatch yet.

2026-05-15 11:50 PDT: added another local-only package validation slice to
the same held batch: commit `5ab7f9590`
(`test(packages): cover registry validation reporting`). It extends
`tools/scripts/test_validate_registry_extra.py` to cover non-strict warning
exit behavior without `--check-licenses`, confirm license warnings are not
printed when license checking is disabled, and verify package status prints
`FAIL` when a slug-specific license error is present. Local validation
passed `python3 tools/scripts/test_validate_registry_extra.py` (10 tests),
`python3 tools/packages/test_package_validation_tools.py` (14 tests), and
`git diff --check`. Held batch is now four commits ahead of current
`origin/main` and remains unpushed.

2026-05-15 12:27 PDT: reconciled the active working objective with the
current user direction. The thread-level `/goal` still contains the older
paused local-only/no-CI objective and cannot be edited or resumed with the
available goal tool, so this ledger entry is the operative policy for the
remaining Phase 3 Codecov work. Continue using GitHub-hosted CI only; do
not dispatch Namespace or SSH-host validation. Build future coverage work
as broad, coherent domain batches rather than small one-off PRs, targeting
roughly a dozen meaningful coverage slices per submitted PR when practical.
Validate locally on macOS before pushing, push/submit batched PRs when the
batch is substantial, monitor owned PRs periodically, fix deterministic
failures at the root cause, and merge only after required GitHub checks and
Codecov are green. Keep held local batches and live PR status recorded here.

Current consolidated PR status at this checkpoint:

- #2048 `feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-platform-consolidated-657` is on
  pushed SHA `41ebdb229b82355283d3eb446666f6f717296a87`; no failures yet,
  14 GitHub-hosted checks still pending. The latest push rewrote
  `analytics.cpp` escape branches so LLVM line coverage can see the actual
  escaped cases and added a separate malformed dashed UUID test. Local
  focused validation passed for `pulp-test-analytics` and
  `pulp-test-identity`. Push used pre-push diff-cover demotion because the
  local coverage configure hit an external FetchContent checkout issue for
  `mbedtls v3.6.2`; GitHub-hosted CI remains authoritative.
- #2049 `feature/phase3-codecov-media-consolidated-658` is on SHA
  `c2d15a57f90962c1812200ca644c30d2a09b3d21`; GitHub checks are complete
  but `codecov/patch` is still failing, so it is not merge-ready.
- #2050 `feature/phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660` is on SHA
  `4ed92c7181148baae0c0d9f80202f7b83cc7dfd9`; `Diff coverage required` and
  `codecov/patch` are failing, with 3 checks still pending. CI logs show
  the relevant AssetManager and PresetBrowser tests execute, but coverage
  artifacts show the specific diff lines remain zero-hit. A local focused
  coverage reproduction is running in
  `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660` to identify the
  real root cause before patching.
- #2051 `feature/phase3-codecov-tools-host-format-consolidated-659` is on
  SHA `6fc610acd4648a8e57d95766d8f33d289c7978a1`; no failures currently,
  4 GitHub-hosted checks pending after the unresolved-plugin label fix.

Resume action: finish the local #2050 coverage reproduction, patch the
root cause if confirmed, then continue monitoring #2048/#2049/#2050/#2051.
After those are stable, continue adding to the held ship/package batch and
future large domain batches before opening new GitHub-hosted PRs.

2026-05-15 12:30 PDT: #2050 local focused coverage reproduction completed
in `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660`. The focused
CTest run passed both
`PresetBrowser ignores filtered clicks before the list starts` and
`AssetManager font file loading derives family names and uses cache`.
The generated Cobertura report showed the exact diff-gate lines hit
locally: `preset_browser.hpp` lines 215-217 hit once and
`asset_manager.cpp` lines 206, 207, 210, and 212 hit once. This confirms
the current test paths cover the reported diff lines on macOS and that the
previous GitHub diff-gate failure was not a missing test assertion. Reran
the GitHub-hosted Coverage workflow for #2050 (`25932577890`); after the
rerun, `Diff coverage required` was no longer listed as failing, with the
Coverage rerun still pending and `codecov/patch` still red until Codecov
recomputes.

2026-05-15 12:33 PDT: investigated #2049's isolated `codecov/patch`
failure. GitHub's required diff gate and all build/coverage/sanitizer jobs
were green, but Codecov reported patch coverage below the 75% target even
though the visible diff against current `origin/main` was test-only. The
branch merge-base was stale (`a65d223427868efd056f281890ce97d8120c1397`),
so the consolidated merge history was likely confusing Codecov's patch
comparison. Flattened the current visible test-only diff onto current
`origin/main` and force-with-lease updated the existing PR branch to
`fbc9f1c22b9fb64bc4ecec34f581ae663e661778`
(`test: consolidate media codecov queue`). Local validation before push:
`git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` passed, and the pre-push hook passed
with no mapped skill-sync/compat-sync paths touched plus its 20-test
check. No Namespace or SSH validation was used. Fresh GitHub-hosted checks
are now pending on #2049 with no failures at the time of this entry.

2026-05-15 12:34 PDT: continued the held local ship/package batch after
rebasing `feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661` onto current
`origin/main` `664c2c52f`. Added commit `7eee37120`
(`test(release): cover skia fetch archive edges`) extending
`tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release.py` with coverage for missing
CLI arguments, unknown-platform warning output, Windows archive flattening,
and the no-clobber branch when an arch subdirectory contains a duplicate
library name. Local validation passed
`python3 tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release.py` (17 tests) and
`git diff --check`. The batch is now five commits ahead of current
`origin/main` and remains local-only/unpushed while the active GitHub PR
queue drains.

2026-05-15 12:38 PDT: added two more held local release coverage slices
to `feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`: commit `b3d29bc75`
(`test(release): cover package cli selection edges`) covers WGPU library
build-dir precedence over cache roots plus macOS dual-binary rpath
rewriting; commit `5186458da` (`test(release): cover auto-release parser
edges`) covers auto-release semver parsing, malformed-version comparison,
and CLI help behavior. Local validation passed the focused and adjacent
Python suites:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_auto_release_decision.py` (27 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_package_cli_extra.py` (17 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release.py` (17 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_release_workflow_test_step.py` (9 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_validate_registry_extra.py` (10 tests),
`python3 tools/packages/test_package_validation_tools.py` (14 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held batch is now seven commits ahead of current
`origin/main`, touches 9 files, adds 947 lines of release/package/ship
coverage, and remains intentionally unpushed until it reaches a substantial
PR-sized corpus or the active GitHub queue clears.

2026-05-15 12:41 PDT: added commit `8b0e56ccc`
(`test(ci): cover local validation helper edges`) to the same held batch.
It extends `tools/scripts/test_android_target.py` for Linux default SDK
discovery and successful Gradle builds that do not leave the expected APK
path, and extends `tools/scripts/test_validate_hosts.py` for Windows
`-NoTests:$true` command construction plus the default-current-branch path
when `--branch` is omitted. These are unit-level tests only; no Android
build, SSH host, or Namespace validation was invoked. Local validation
passed `python3 tools/scripts/test_android_target.py` (18 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_validate_hosts.py` (11 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held batch is now eight commits ahead of current
`origin/main`, touches 11 files, and adds 1007 lines of package/release/CI
helper coverage while remaining unpushed.

2026-05-15 13:51 PDT: rebased the held ship/package/local-CI batch onto
current `origin/main` `52288609a` and added commit `18e981bfb`
(`test(ci): cover local ci state path edges`). The new slice extends
`tools/local-ci/test_local_ci_extra.py` for macOS/Linux state-directory
fallbacks, desktop artifact-root fallbacks, state directory creation, and
target-log preparation. Local validation passed
`python3 tools/local-ci/test_local_ci_extra.py` (19 tests),
`python3 tools/local-ci/test_local_ci.py` (213 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held batch is now nine commits ahead of current
`origin/main`, touches 12 files, and adds 1045 lines of package/release/CI
helper coverage. It remains local-only and intentionally unpushed until it
is large enough to justify one GitHub-hosted PR or the current PR queue
clears.

2026-05-15 15:04 PDT: added release-discovery coverage slice
`159cbce81` (`test(release): cover migration index codegen edges`) to the
held ship/package/local-CI batch. It extends
`tools/scripts/test_build_migration_index_extra.py` for non-empty C++
codegen source comments, default non-breaking entries, table-size wiring,
and empty-docs CLI output. Local validation passed
`python3 tools/scripts/test_build_migration_index_extra.py` (12 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_build_migration_index.py` (7 tests),
`python3 tools/local-ci/test_local_ci_extra.py` (19 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_android_target.py` (18 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_validate_hosts.py` (11 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held batch is now ten commits ahead of current
`origin/main`, touches 13 files, and adds 1076 lines of focused
ship/package/release/local-CI coverage. It remains unpushed until the
current GitHub PR queue is ready for one substantial batched PR.

2026-05-15 15:26 PDT: fixed #2048
`feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-platform-consolidated-657` after
investigating the failing `Diff coverage required`/`codecov/patch` checks.
The latest GitHub coverage artifact showed `core/runtime/src/analytics.cpp`
lines 9-28, 56, and 62 plus `core/runtime/src/identity.cpp` lines 44-48
and 56-58 as zero-hit, even though the relevant
`FileAnalyticsDestination` and `Uuid` tests ran and passed on CI. Local
focused coverage reproduced the issue as an llvm-cov object-discovery
ordering problem: source files compiled into both `libpulp-*.a` archives
and executed test binaries can report the archive's zero-hit coverage map
if archives are appended after tests. Commit `786c3681d`
(`test(coverage): prefer executed test maps in llvm-cov`) updates
`scripts/run_coverage.sh` and `tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` to add
static archives before test executables, and adds parity coverage in
`tools/scripts/test_local_diff_cover.py`.

Validation for #2048 before push: `python3 tools/scripts/test_local_diff_cover.py`
passed 17 tests; `git diff --check` passed; `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-analytics pulp-test-identity -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)` passed;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R "FileAnalyticsDestination|Uuid"`
passed 15 tests; and a focused `scripts/run_coverage.sh --tests
"FileAnalyticsDestination|Uuid"` run completed with all 15 tests passing.
The generated LCOV then showed nonzero hits for every previously missing
diff line: `analytics.cpp` lines 9-28, 56, and 62, and `identity.cpp`
lines 44-48 and 56-58. Pushed #2048 to GitHub-hosted CI at
`786c3681d`. The pre-push hook also attempted its advisory local
diff-cover path and hit an unrelated local FetchContent `mbedtls` tag
checkout failure, but the push completed with that gate demoted; do not
rely on that advisory run as validation.

2026-05-15 15:31 PDT: added another release/package automation slice to
the held local batch `feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`.
Commit `6d6c011fd` (`test(release): cover mcp package and bump guard
edges`) extends package CLI coverage for Linux tarballs that include all
three binaries (`pulp`, `pulp-cpp`, and `pulp-mcp`) and verifies all three
get Linux rpath rewriting. It also extends version-bump coverage for
metadata-stripped config loading, default trailer-key selection, JSON-path
array/scalar miss handling, and accepted vs near-miss bump-marker commit
subjects. While running adjacent release workflow tests, the existing
test still looked for the old two-binary smoke step names; updated it to
assert the current `pulp`/`pulp-cpp`/`pulp-mcp --version` package and
smoke contract from `release-cli.yml`.

Validation for the held slice passed locally:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_package_cli_extra.py` (18 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_version_bump_check_extra.py` (36 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_release_workflow_test_step.py` (9 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_package_cli.py` (17 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_auto_release_decision.py` (27 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held batch is now 11 commits ahead of
`origin/main`, touches 14 files, and adds 1195 lines of focused
ship/package/release/local-CI coverage. It remains local-only and
intentionally unpushed so it can land as one substantial GitHub-hosted CI
run instead of many small PRs.

2026-05-15 15:41 PDT: refreshed #2050
`feature/phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660` to address a stale
Codecov patch failure. GitHub showed the `codecov/patch` check failing
with "61.53% of diff hit", but the Codecov v2 PR API reported
`patch.coverage` as 78.12% with CI passed and the check-run metadata was
still tied to old base SHA `a65d22342`. This matched the stale-base
pattern fixed earlier on #2049, so the branch was rebased onto current
`origin/main` `52288609a` rather than hiding the issue or weakening
coverage. Rebase conflicts were resolved in `test/test_phase9_widgets.cpp`,
`test/test_tree_view.cpp`, and `test/test_graph_editor_view.cpp` by
preserving both overlapping coverage additions.

Validation before push: `git diff --check` passed; selected view targets
built with `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-phase9-widgets
pulp-test-tree-view pulp-test-graph-editor-view pulp-test-asset-manager
pulp-test-preset-browser -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`; and
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"Phase9|TreeView|GraphEditorView|AssetManager|PresetBrowser"` passed 70
tests. Force-with-lease pushed #2050 at `7451c25f4` to trigger a fresh
GitHub-hosted/Codecov recomputation. The pre-push hook again attempted
its advisory local diff-cover path and hit the unrelated local
FetchContent `mbedtls` tag checkout failure; do not treat that advisory
run as validation. Live PR rollup check was deferred because `gh pr view`
hit the GitHub GraphQL API rate limit immediately after push.

2026-05-15 15:47 PDT: added a pure coverage-gate script slice to the held
local batch `feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`. Commit
`77833ea33` (`test(coverage): cover coverage gate script edges`) extends
`tools/scripts/test_coverage_tier_check_extra.py` with missing-instrumented
source aggregation, unclassified-source skipping, non-instrumented tier
skipping without diff-line shellout, case-insensitive C-family extension
classification, exact React-package surface matching, and failed-tier
rendering assertions. It also extends
`tools/scripts/test_coverage_diff_comment_extra.py` with required-mode
empty-report rendering, heading-only report normalization, and direct
`main(... --no-advisory ...)` output coverage.

Validation for this held slice passed locally:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_coverage_tier_check_extra.py` (23 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_coverage_tier_check.py` (24 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_coverage_diff_comment.py` (11 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_coverage_diff_comment_extra.py` (8 tests),
and `git diff --check`. The ship/package/release/local-CI batch is now
12 commits ahead of `origin/main` and remains intentionally local-only
until it is large enough, or the active GitHub-hosted CI queue clears
enough, to justify one substantial PR instead of smaller CI runs.

2026-05-15 15:48 PDT: added a GitHub runner resolver script slice to the
held local batch `feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`. Commit
`277befe94` (`test(ci): cover runner resolver selector edges`) extends
`tools/scripts/test_resolve_runs_on_extra.py` with direct selector JSON
acceptance/rejection coverage, empty/missing/whitespace env normalization,
custom requested-provider env handling for local runners, and
optional-namespace main output when GitHub-hosted is requested. This is
aligned with the current CI policy for the codecov queue: avoid Namespace,
prefer GitHub-hosted, and keep resolver behavior explicit.

Validation for this held slice passed locally:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_resolve_runs_on_extra.py` (8 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_resolve_runs_on.py` (19 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The batch is now 13 commits ahead of `origin/main`
and is still intentionally held local-only rather than pushed as another
small CI run.

2026-05-15 15:58 PDT: pushed a targeted #2051 repair on
`feature/phase3-codecov-tools-host-format-consolidated-659` at
`f446d2033` (`test(view): cover widget repaint and host capture edges`).
The stale/failing Codecov patch report for #2051 was concentrated in
`core/view/include/pulp/view/widgets.hpp` and
`core/view/include/pulp/view/window_host.hpp`, so this adds direct tests
for the cheap uncovered branches rather than suppressing the check:
`WindowHost` back-buffer capture delegation, idempotent `Fader` and
`ToggleButton` label setters, and `Knob::set_format` repaint behavior
without changing the current value.

Validation before push passed locally:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-widgets
pulp-test-standalone-editor-chrome -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"Widget setters skip repaint|Widget set_label|Knob format setter|WindowHost
default content-size"` passed 4 tests; `git diff --check` passed; and a
focused `scripts/run_coverage.sh --tests
"Widget setters skip repaint|Widget set_label|Knob format setter|WindowHost
default content-size"` completed with those same 4 tests passing under
coverage. The generated whole-tree coverage percentage is intentionally
not meaningful for this targeted run because only four tests were
selected against the full instrumented object set. Push completed, but
the pre-push advisory diff-cover path again hit the unrelated local
FetchContent `mbedtls` `v3.6.2` checkout failure in a fresh `build-cov`;
do not treat that advisory run as validation. REST check-rollup after
push showed #2051 pending with no failing check-runs.

2026-05-15 16:02 PDT: refreshed the held local batch
`feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661` onto latest
`origin/main` and added another release-helper coverage slice. The rebase
was clean; because this branch is still local-only, the rewritten commit
hashes are not externally visible. New head commit `434b26c8e`
(`test(release): cover release helper edge cases`) adds tests for Skia
release fetch no-asset logging, archive cleanup, and missing-library
debug output; package registry structural/license clean and missing-license
edges; Android SDK fallback when env paths are stale plus empty Java
version output; and validate-host config passthrough, subprocess cwd, and
continuing remote checks after local failure.

Validation for this held slice passed locally:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release.py` (19 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_validate_registry_extra.py` (12 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_android_target.py` (20 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_validate_hosts.py` (14 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held ship/package/release/local-CI batch is now
14 commits ahead of `origin/main`, touches 17 files, and adds about 1,560
lines of focused tests. It remains intentionally unpushed so it can become
one substantial GitHub-hosted CI run rather than several small PRs.

2026-05-15 16:04 PDT: added a native Android packaging discovery slice
to the held local batch. Commit `2af985c95` (`test(android): cover sdk
fallback revision edges`) extends `test/test_android_package.cpp` to cover
invalid `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` fallback to valid
`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` and SDK-hosted NDKs, plus very large Android build-tools
and NDK revision components. These exercise the overflow-safe revision
ordering paths without requiring a real Android SDK.

Validation for this held slice passed locally:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-android-package -j$(sysctl -n
hw.ncpu)`, `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R "Android SDK
discovery"` (8 tests), and `git diff --check`. The held
ship/package/release/local-CI batch is now 15 commits ahead of
`origin/main` and remains intentionally local-only.

2026-05-15 16:06 PDT: added a Python coverage-infrastructure helper slice
to the held local batch. Commit `98c14db9d` (`test(coverage): cover python
coverage helper edges`) extends `tools/scripts/test_run_python_coverage_extra.py`
with selected-surface always-include behavior, source-root normalization,
report-source omit filtering, and `.coveragerc` writing/error coverage. It
also extends `tools/scripts/test_merge_cobertura_extra.py` with Windows path
normalization plus ignored-source filtering, all-inputs-missing exit code
coverage, and corrupt-XML hard-failure coverage.

Validation for this held slice passed locally:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_run_python_coverage_extra.py` (12 tests),
`python3 tools/scripts/test_merge_cobertura_extra.py` (6 tests), and
`git diff --check`. The held ship/package/release/local-CI batch is now
16 commits ahead of `origin/main`, touches 19 files, and adds about 1,697
lines of focused tests. It remains intentionally local-only while the
active GitHub-hosted CI queue drains.

2026-05-15 16:08 PDT: ran a broader local validation pass over the held
batch after the latest coverage slices. The Python validation covered the
package/release helpers (`test_package_cli.py`, `test_package_cli_extra.py`,
`test_fetch_skia_for_release.py`, `test_auto_release_decision.py`,
`test_version_bump_check_extra.py`, `test_release_workflow_test_step.py`),
coverage helpers (`test_coverage_tier_check.py`,
`test_coverage_tier_check_extra.py`, `test_coverage_diff_comment.py`,
`test_coverage_diff_comment_extra.py`, `test_run_python_coverage_extra.py`,
`test_merge_cobertura_extra.py`, `test_resolve_runs_on.py`,
`test_resolve_runs_on_extra.py`), Android/local-CI/package registry helpers
(`test_android_target.py`, `test_build_migration_index_extra.py`,
`test_validate_hosts.py`, `test_validate_registry_extra.py`,
`tools/local-ci/test_local_ci_extra.py`), and `git diff --check`.

Native validation also passed: `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-android-package pulp-test-appcast pulp-test-codesign
pulp-test-nsis-installer -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)` succeeded, followed by
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R "Android|Appcast|codesign|NSIS"`
with 55/55 tests passing. The held branch was clean after validation and
remains queued locally for one future substantial GitHub-hosted CI run.

2026-05-15 16:13 PDT: published the held batch as #2097,
`test: batch ship package coverage helpers`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`. This intentionally turns
the accumulated 16 local commits into one GitHub-hosted CI run rather than
many small PRs. Before opening the PR, the tip commit was amended from
`98c14db9d` to `89de2d8ba` to add the required
`Skill-Update: skip skill=ci reason="test-only local CI and coverage helper
edge coverage; CI workflow guidance unchanged"` trailer. The branch was
force-with-lease pushed, then #2097 was opened with the `codecov` label.

Initial #2097 check-rollup after PR creation showed 12 pending, 0 failing,
and 3 successful check-runs. The local pre-push hook had clean
skill/version/compat/docs-noise/deps gates after the trailer amendment, but
its advisory diff-cover path still hit the unrelated local FetchContent
`mbedtls` `v3.6.2` checkout failure in fresh `build-cov`; the broader
validation listed above is the local validation source of record.

2026-05-15 16:18 PDT: started the next held local runtime/audio batch in
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-662` on
`feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-662`, current head
`81f700dca` (`test(runtime): cover temp file and scope guard edges`).
This first local-only slice extends `test/test_runtime_utils.cpp` with
additional `TemporaryFile` coverage for bare-extension normalization,
`path_string()`, and move-assignment cleanup of the previously owned file,
plus direct `ScopeGuard` coverage for destructor execution, `dismiss()`,
move transfer, and `PULP_ON_SCOPE_EXIT` capture behavior.

Validation for this slice passed locally:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils -j$(sysctl -n
hw.ncpu)`; `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"PULP_ON_SCOPE_EXIT|TemporaryFile|ScopeGuard"` with 8/8 tests passing; and
`git diff --check`. This branch remains intentionally local-only while it
accumulates more runtime/audio coverage into a larger GitHub-hosted batch PR.
The current PR queue sweep showed #2048, #2049, #2050, #2051, and #2097
with no failing check-runs; several required checks are still pending.

2026-05-15 16:21 PDT: extended the same held local runtime/audio batch to
three commits ahead of `origin/main`, current head `e0bc4ca4d`
(`test(runtime): cover message callback clearing`). New commits after the
initial runtime utility slice are `2074e68e3` (`test(runtime): cover json
rpc protocol edges`) and `e0bc4ca4d`. The JSON-RPC slice covers string
request-id response preservation, omitted-params dispatch as an empty
params payload, and failed notification sends. The message-channel slice
covers clearing a previously installed in-memory message callback.

Validation for the accumulated held batch passed locally:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils pulp-test-json-rpc
pulp-test-memory-message-channel -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"PULP_ON_SCOPE_EXIT|TemporaryFile|ScopeGuard|JsonRpcPeer|MemoryMessageChannel"`
with 25/25 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. The branch remains
local-only so it can keep accumulating into one larger GitHub-hosted CI
batch. REST queue sweep after validation showed #2048, #2049, #2050,
#2051, and #2097 still with no failing check-runs; #2048/#2051 each had
one fewer pending check than the prior sweep.

2026-05-15 16:24 PDT: extended the held runtime/audio batch to six commits
ahead of `origin/main`, current head `de855b2fd` (`test(runtime): cover
default http stream state`). Additional local-only commits are
`2ba25e795` (`test(runtime): cover file stream position edges`),
`8b8325cbe` (`test(runtime): cover http response status helper`), and
`de855b2fd`. These add coverage for `StreamResult` helper predicates,
`FileStream` read/write-mode position, zero-byte I/O, closed flush/position
edges, `HttpResponse::ok()` boundary statuses, and default `HttpStream`
eof/zero-read/close behavior.

Validation for the accumulated branch passed locally:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils pulp-test-json-rpc
pulp-test-memory-message-channel pulp-test-stream pulp-test-network-stream
-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"PULP_ON_SCOPE_EXIT|TemporaryFile|ScopeGuard|HttpResponse|HTTP helpers|JsonRpcPeer|MemoryMessageChannel|StreamResult|FileStream|MemoryStream|Stream polymorphic|HttpStream"`
with 44/44 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. The branch remains
local-only while it grows toward the larger PR batch size. REST queue sweep
showed no failing check-runs on #2048, #2049, #2050, #2051, or #2097; #2050
also dropped one pending check since the prior sweep.

2026-05-15 16:27 PDT: extended the held runtime/audio batch to eight commits
ahead of `origin/main`, current head `27c1d1fd` (`test(runtime): cover
bigint assignment edges`). Additional commits after the six-commit mark are
`d823f799f` (`test(runtime): cover spsc queue capacity helper`) and
`27c1d1fd`. These cover `SpscQueue::capacity()`, rvalue queue pushes, and
`BigInteger` copy/move assignment behavior without changing runtime code.

Validation for the accumulated branch passed locally:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils pulp-test-json-rpc
pulp-test-memory-message-channel pulp-test-stream pulp-test-network-stream
pulp-test-runtime pulp-test-license -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"PULP_ON_SCOPE_EXIT|TemporaryFile|ScopeGuard|HttpResponse|HTTP helpers|JsonRpcPeer|MemoryMessageChannel|StreamResult|FileStream|MemoryStream|Stream polymorphic|HttpStream|SpscQueue|BigInteger"`
with 64/64 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. The branch remains
local-only; target size is still a larger GitHub-hosted batch rather than a
small PR.

2026-05-15 16:31 PDT: grew and published the held runtime/audio batch as
#2098, `test: batch runtime coverage helpers`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-662` at `ee1bc9e2f`. The final
batch contains 12 focused test-only commits, touches 7 test files, and adds
345 lines. Additional commits after the eight-commit checkpoint are
`d1900601e` (`test(runtime): cover localtime helper`), `1a5f95d5b`
(`test(runtime): cover mmap readwrite move edges`), `a53698c86`
(`test(runtime): cover dynamic library open moves`), and `ee1bc9e2f`
(`test(runtime): cover child process stderr capture`).

Final local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils pulp-test-json-rpc
pulp-test-memory-message-channel pulp-test-stream pulp-test-network-stream
pulp-test-runtime pulp-test-license -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;

with 79/79 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. The branch push ran clean
pre-push gates with `PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`;
no Namespace/SSH lanes were used. #2098 was opened via GitHub REST and
labeled `codecov`; initial PR state is blocked while GitHub-hosted checks
queue.

2026-05-15 18:00 PDT: monitored #2098 and fixed the first GitHub-hosted
Windows failure. `Windows (x64) [github-hosted]` failed only
`run_process captures stderr separately`; the Windows branch emitted
`bad news` while the assertion searched for the shared `bad-news` sentinel.
Commit `796c62cc0` (`test(runtime): make stderr sentinel portable`) changes
the PowerShell command to write `bad-news` via `[Console]::Error.WriteLine`.

Validation before push passed locally:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils -j$(sysctl -n
hw.ncpu)`, `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"run_process captures stderr separately|run_process"` with 4/4 tests
passing, and `git diff --check`. Push pre-push gates were clean with
`PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`. #2098 is now at
`796c62cc0`; GitHub-hosted checks restarted on the new head.

2026-05-15 18:10 PDT: started the next held local audio/tools coverage
batch in `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-audio-runtime-batch-663` on
`feature/phase3-codecov-audio-runtime-batch-663`, based on `origin/main`
`85bd37efa`. Current head is `d53bcb072` (`test(audio): cover excerpt find
validation paths`), four commits ahead of `origin/main`: `394a3e1c0`
(`test(audio): cover primitive shape defaults`), `641f581d2` (`test(audio):
guard mapped reader destinations`), `d728bab05` (`test(audio): cover model
store JSON helpers`), and `d53bcb072`.

Coverage added so far:
- `test/test_audio.cpp`: zero-channel/zero-sample buffer states,
  `AudioFileData` shape helpers, and `DeviceInfo`/`DeviceConfig` defaults.
- `core/audio/src/mmap_reader.cpp` + `test/test_audio_file.cpp`: reject null
  destination channel buffers in `MemoryMappedAudioReader::read_frames()`
  instead of dereferencing them.
- `test/test_audio_tools.cpp`: model-store override paths, legacy
  `checkpoint_path` metadata, active-model fallback keys, model/bundle JSON
  serializer fields, excerpt-find request validation, unsupported-input
  reporting, and `ExcerptFindResult` JSON fields.

Validation passed locally on macOS:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-audio pulp-test-audio-file
pulp-test-audio-tools -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)` via focused target builds;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R

with 2/2 tests passing; `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"excerpt find validates|required request|excerpt find reports unsupported|excerpt

branch remains intentionally local-only while it grows toward the larger
GitHub-hosted batch size.

2026-05-15 18:19 PDT: grew and published the held audio/tools batch as
#2099, `test: batch audio tooling coverage`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-audio-runtime-batch-663` at `121c5c46a`. The final
batch contains 12 focused commits and is labeled `codecov`.

Additional commits after the four-commit checkpoint are `7b449939c`
(`test(audio): cover excerpt find collection edges`), `208229b4f`
(`test(audio): cover excerpt bundle fallbacks`), `0d4814144`
(`test(audio): cover model registry helpers`), `5434e12f5` (`test(audio):

fallbacks`), `905645cf1` (`test(audio): cover model activation fallbacks`),
and `121c5c46a` (`test(audio): cover malformed model metadata`).

Final local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-audio pulp-test-audio-file
pulp-test-audio-excerpt pulp-test-buffering-reader pulp-test-audio-tools

`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"Buffer|AudioFileData|Device metadata|ChannelSet|MemoryMappedAudioReader|AudioSubsectionReader|BufferingReader|audio model|excerpt bundle|excerpt find"`
with 59/59 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. The first push was blocked
by the local version-bump gate, so the tip commit was amended with
`Version-Bump: sdk=skip reason="test-only coverage batch; no SDK or CLI
surface change"`. The second push passed local pre-push gates with
`PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1 PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1`.
No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-15 18:32 PDT: prepared the next held events/IPC/service-discovery
coverage batch in `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-events-batch-664` on
`feature/phase3-codecov-events-batch-664`, based on `origin/main`
`85bd37efa`. Current head is `0934f48f` (`test(events): cover IPC client
disconnect lifecycle`), 12 commits ahead of `origin/main`.

The batch covers root fixes plus focused tests for:
- `EventLoop`: empty task handling, due delayed tasks, post-stop dispatches,
  and nested dispatch from the loop thread.
- `Timer`: empty callback handling and one-shot restart/stop-before-fire edges.
- `ActionBroadcaster`: empty callbacks and mutation-safe snapshot dispatch.
- `MountedVolumeListChangeDetector`: prompt stop wakeups for long poll
  intervals.
- `NetworkServiceDiscovery`: browse reuse and backend removal no-op paths.
- `InterprocessConnection`: socket binary frames and disconnect callbacks.

Final local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-events pulp-test-ipc
pulp-test-network-service-discovery -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R
"EventLoop|Timer|ActionBroadcaster|IPC|NSD|MountedVolumeListChangeDetector|LockingAsyncUpdater"`
with 57/57 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. No Namespace/SSH validation
was dispatched.

2026-05-15 18:35 PDT: published the held events/IPC/service-discovery batch
as #2100, `test: batch events coverage`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-events-batch-664` at `0934f48f`. The branch push
passed local pre-push gates with
`PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1
PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1`; the tip commit carries
`Version-Bump: sdk=skip reason="coverage and internal robustness batch; no
SDK or CLI surface change"`. #2100 was opened via the GitHub REST API after
`gh pr create` hit the GraphQL rate limit, and it is labeled `codecov`.

2026-05-15 20:35 PDT: addressed the initial GitHub-hosted coverage failures
on #2099 and #2100.

#2099 initially failed Codecov/diff-cover on the mapped-reader destination
guard (`core/audio/src/mmap_reader.cpp`). CI proved the new
`MemoryMappedAudioReader` tests were running and passing, but the LLVM
coverage report still showed the entire `mmap_reader.cpp` translation unit
at 0%, so that production guard is not a reliable Codecov tranche until the
coverage visibility issue is fixed. Commit `08dd13309` reverts only
`641f581d2` (`test(audio): guard mapped reader destinations`) to keep the
audio batch greenable without hiding the separate instrumentation problem.
Focused local validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-audio pulp-test-audio-file
pulp-test-audio-excerpt pulp-test-buffering-reader pulp-test-audio-tools -j8`;
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R

with 21/21 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. Push used
`PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; the local
diff-cover pre-push lane attempted a fresh coverage configure but failed on
a FetchContent checkout of `mbedtls` tag `v3.6.2`, then demoted as intended.
No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

#2100 initially failed Codecov patch coverage in the event batch. Commit
`f94323730` (`test(events): cover volume detector poll cycle`) adds a
deterministic `MountedVolumeListChangeDetector` test that lets the poll
interval expire before stopping, covering the timeout path in addition to
the existing stop-wakeup path. Focused local validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-events pulp-test-ipc
pulp-test-network-service-discovery -j8`; `ctest --test-dir build
--output-on-failure -R
"EventLoop skips empty|EventLoop dispatch_after runs due|EventLoop ignores new dispatches|EventLoop runs tasks|Timer tolerates empty|Timer one-shot can be restarted|Timer stop before first fire|ActionBroadcaster skips empty|ActionBroadcaster snapshots|MountedVolumeListChangeDetector|IPC|NetworkServiceDiscovery"`
with 29/29 tests passing; and `git diff --check`. Push used
`PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; the same local
`mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure was demoted. GitHub-hosted
CI restarted on both new heads.

2026-05-15 20:50 PDT: queue policy update. Going forward, do not publish
small Codecov/test PRs from this lane. Build coverage work locally in held
batch worktrees and only open a GitHub PR when the batch is large enough to
justify a full GitHub-hosted CI cycle: target roughly 12+ coherent commits
or an equivalently broad related subsystem cluster. Prefer one substantial
PR per area over multiple narrow PRs. Keep the ledger updated with local
validation and batch contents while held. Existing open PRs should be
monitored, fixed, merged on green, or folded only when doing so reduces
queue pressure without losing review/CI signal. No Namespace/SSH validation;
use GitHub-hosted CI and macOS local focused validation.

2026-05-15 20:56 PDT: collapsed the still-open Codecov/test PR queue into
one replacement GitHub-hosted CI run. Created
`feature/phase3-codecov-megabatch-666` in
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-megabatch-666` from `origin/main`
`85bd37efa`, then merged the current heads of:

- #2048 `feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-platform-consolidated-657`
- #2049 `feature/phase3-codecov-media-consolidated-658`
- #2050 `feature/phase3-codecov-view-consolidated-660`
- #2051 `feature/phase3-codecov-tools-host-format-consolidated-659`
- #2097 `feature/phase3-codecov-ship-package-batch-661`
- #2098 `feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-662`
- #2099 `feature/phase3-codecov-audio-runtime-batch-663`
- #2100 `feature/phase3-codecov-events-batch-664`

Resolved merge conflicts in `test/test_license.cpp`,
`test/test_runtime_utils.cpp`, and `test/test_audio_tools.cpp` by preserving
the broader existing assertions and adding the unique assertions from the
incoming branches. Local validation passed: `cmake -S . -B build
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`; full `cmake --build build -j8`; and focused
`ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R

apply"` with 90/90 tests passing. Push used
`PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1 PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; the local
diff-cover pre-push lane attempted a coverage configure and hit the known
FetchContent checkout failure for `mbedtls` tag `v3.6.2`, then demoted as
advisory. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

Opened #2102, `test: consolidate phase 3 codecov coverage queue`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-megabatch-666`, labeled `codecov` and `tests`.
Immediately commented and closed the superseded open PRs #2048, #2049,
#2050, #2051, #2097, #2098, #2099, and #2100 so those smaller branches stop
consuming separate GitHub/macOS CI runs. Monitor #2102 only for this combined
queue. Future Codecov work should continue as held local batches until the
batch is large enough to justify one GitHub-hosted CI run.

2026-05-15 21:19 PDT: published the next large state/parameter coverage
batch as #2103, `test: batch state coverage edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-state-batch-665` at `c096457a2`. This is a single
12-commit GitHub-hosted CI batch rather than separate small PRs.

Batch contents cover:
- `StateStore` deserialize clamp, bad-magic, future-version, listener, and
  `ParamValue` primitive edges.
- `StateTree` listener, child-removal, typed-getter, malformed JSON, and
  synchronizer decode/remove edges.
- `Binding` empty callback and unknown-parameter reset robustness.
- `EditHistory` runtime max-depth trimming and zero-depth behavior.
- `PropertiesFile` scalar parser and malformed JSON shape edges.
- `PresetManager` empty navigation, discovery, `PresetInfo` load, and
  rename/current-name edges.

Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-state pulp-test-state-tree
pulp-test-binding pulp-test-properties pulp-test-preset-manager
pulp-test-edit-history -j8`; `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
-R "ParamRange|ParamValue|StateStore|StateTree|ObservableValue|CachedProperty|PropertiesFile|ApplicationProperties|Binding|PresetManager|EditHistory"`
with 116/116 tests passing; and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`.
The first push was blocked by the version-bump gate because state headers
changed; the tip commit was amended with
`Version-Bump: sdk=skip reason="state robustness and coverage batch; no SDK
or CLI API surface change"`, then pre-push gates passed. No Namespace/SSH
validation was dispatched.

2026-05-15 21:34 PDT: addressed Codex P2 review comments on #2102 and
#2103, then published the next held MIDI coverage batch as #2104.

#2102 follow-up: commit `71b82e141` (`fix(coverage): require test binaries
before upload`) fixes the coverage helper guard so archive discovery cannot
make the "no test binaries found" check ineffective. `scripts/run_coverage.sh`
now tracks discovered test executables separately in `TEST_BINARIES` and
requires that list to be non-empty before upload proceeds. Local validation:
`bash -n scripts/run_coverage.sh` and `git diff --check`. The local diff-cover
pre-push lane attempted a fresh coverage configure but hit the known
FetchContent checkout failure for `mbedtls` tag `v3.6.2`, then was demoted
with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`. No Namespace/SSH validation was
dispatched.

#2103 follow-up: commit `e1fc40380` (`fix(state): preserve explicit null sync
values`) fixes the state-tree synchronizer so only an actual absent property
is classified as `PropertyRemove`; explicit `set(key, PropertyValue{})`
remains a `PropertySet`. Added a regression proving `apply()` preserves
`has("nullable")` for explicit null values. Focused local validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-state-tree -j8`; `ctest --test-dir
build --output-on-failure -R "StateTree"` with 33/33 tests passing; and
`git diff --check`. The local diff-cover pre-push lane hit the same
`mbedtls v3.6.2` checkout failure and was demoted with
`PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`. No Namespace/SSH validation was
dispatched.

#2104: opened `test(midi): batch coverage edges` on
`feature/phase3-codecov-midi-batch-667` at `831bb88c8`, labeled `codecov`
and `tests`. This is a single MIDI-focused GitHub-hosted CI batch containing
four local tranches instead of separate small PRs:

- `test(midi): cover keyboard rpn and sequence edges`
- `test(midi): cover ump and mpe buffer edges`
- `test(midi): cover capability inquiry edges`
- `test(midi): cover sysex sidecar edges`

The batch covers `MidiKeyboardState`, `RpnParser`, `MidiMessageSequence`,
`MidiBuffer` SysEx sidecars, UMP packet factories, MIDI 1.0/2.0 conversion,
`UmpBuffer`, `MpeBuffer` tracker binding, and MIDI-CI discovery/profile/
property edge cases. Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-midi pulp-test-midi-ci -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-midi` with 19 test cases / 276 assertions passing;
`./build/test/pulp-test-midi-ci` with 18 test cases / 89 assertions passing;
and `git diff --check`. Branch pre-push gates were clean. `gh pr create`
hit the GitHub GraphQL rate limit, so #2104 was opened via the GitHub REST
API. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-15 23:41 PDT: resumed after context compaction, recreated missing
state/MIDI worktrees, and continued GitHub-hosted monitoring only.

#2103 follow-up: GitHub macOS failed in the unrelated
`HotReloader detects file changes` test. Root cause was a real watcher race:
macOS can emit a modified event for a JS file that already existed before
`HotReloader` construction, so the first `poll_reload()` could see a stale
pending reload. Commit `38186634d` (`fix(view): ignore stale hot reload
watcher events`) seeds observed JS write times before starting the watcher
and ignores non-advancing modified events. Focused local validation passed:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-hot-reload -j8`; and
`./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload` with 5 test cases / 16 assertions
passing. Push used `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; the local diff-cover
pre-push lane hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure
and was demoted. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

#2104 monitoring: Windows failed with GitHub's hosted-runner communication
loss annotation, not a test assertion. The failed job cannot be rerun while
the workflow run is still in progress; rerun the failed job/run once the
remaining macOS jobs finish. No code patch is indicated from the current
annotations.

Held local batch: `feature/phase3-codecov-signal-batch-668` is rebased on
current `origin/main` and intentionally not opened yet so it can remain a
larger signal/DSP coverage PR. Current tip is `c924468a4` with four commits:
`test(signal): cover visualization helper edges`,
`test(signal): cover effect reset edges`,
`test(signal): cover envelope ramp edges`, and
`test(signal): cover gate and bias edges`. Current diff adds 413 test lines
across `test/test_dsp_expansion.cpp` and `test/test_signal.cpp`. Local
validation passed after rebase:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-signal pulp-test-dsp-expansion -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-signal` with 88 test cases / 1064 assertions passing;
`./build/test/pulp-test-dsp-expansion` with 41 test cases / 408 assertions
passing; and `git diff --check`. Continue adding related signal/DSP coverage
locally before submitting the next single batched PR.

2026-05-15 23:49 PDT: published the held signal/DSP coverage batch as #2106,
`test(signal): batch DSP coverage edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-signal-batch-668` at `05f81890d`, labeled `codecov`
and `tests`. This keeps the signal/DSP work as one GitHub-hosted CI run
rather than splitting it into smaller PRs.

Batch contents now cover:
- `DelayLine` reprepare/resize clearing and existing wrap/reset behavior.
- `Oscillator` phase/frequency accessors, phase wrap, and reset determinism.
- Envelope ramp/reset paths, effect reset behavior, gate/bias buffer paths,
  and visualization helper edges.
- `SpectrogramBuffer`, `STFT`, `AlignedBuffer`, `Interpolator`, and
  `DryWetMixer` latency-after-prepare/missing-channel behavior.

Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-signal pulp-test-dsp-expansion
pulp-test-dsp-enhancements -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-signal` with 90
test cases / 1078 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-dsp-expansion`
with 41 test cases / 408 assertions passing;
`./build/test/pulp-test-dsp-enhancements` with 23 test cases / 86 assertions
passing; and `git diff --check`. Direct `git push` pre-push gates were clean.
`gh pr create` hit the GitHub GraphQL rate limit, so #2106 was opened via the
GitHub REST API. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

Monitoring state at publish time:
- #2102 has only ASan/TSan queued and its Codex P2 comment was already
  addressed by `71b82e141`.
- #2103 is running the new `38186634d` hot-reload root-cause fix through
  GitHub-hosted CI; macOS/sanitizers are still queued.
- #2104 still has the Windows hosted-runner communication-loss failure while
  macOS remains in progress; rerun the failed Windows job/run after the
  workflow finishes unless a later log shows an actual test failure.
- #2106 checks are queued/running on GitHub-hosted runners only.

2026-05-16 00:00 PDT: started the next held runtime/audio coverage batch
locally on `feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-669` in
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-669`. This branch is
intentionally not opened yet; keep accumulating related runtime/audio tests
before spending another GitHub-hosted CI run.

Current commits:
- `test(runtime): cover stream edge paths`
- `test(audio): cover buffer metadata edges`
- `test(runtime): cover queue slot reuse`

Current coverage additions:
- `StreamResult` helper state checks, `FileStream` position/zero-byte/reopen
  paths, and `PipeStream` closed/open named-pipe wrapper paths.
- `Buffer` zero-channel/const-view edge shapes and `AudioFileData` metadata
  helper behavior for empty/mismatched channel data.
- `SpscQueue` capacity reporting, rvalue push, full rejection, FIFO reuse
  after draining, and empty pop behavior.

Local validation passed:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-stream pulp-test-audio
pulp-test-runtime -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-stream` with 16 test cases /
160 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-audio` with 14 test cases /
645 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-runtime` with 16 test cases /
93 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`.

2026-05-16 00:03 PDT: expanded and published that runtime/audio batch as
#2107, `test(runtime): batch audio and stream coverage edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-669` at `d13bdba21`, labeled
`codecov` and `tests`.

Additional commit:
- `test(runtime): cover memory message channel edges`

Final batch contents cover:
- `StreamResult` helper state checks, `FileStream` position/zero-byte/reopen
  paths, and `PipeStream` closed/open named-pipe wrapper paths.
- `MemoryMessageChannel` empty text/binary payloads, close-callback
  replacement, peer-close behavior, and inert error callback registration.
- `Buffer` zero-channel/const-view edge shapes and `AudioFileData` metadata
  helper behavior for empty/mismatched channel data.
- `SpscQueue` capacity reporting, rvalue push, full rejection, FIFO reuse
  after draining, and empty pop behavior.

Final local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-stream pulp-test-audio
pulp-test-runtime pulp-test-memory-message-channel -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-stream` with 16 test cases / 160 assertions passing;
`./build/test/pulp-test-audio` with 14 test cases / 645 assertions passing;
`./build/test/pulp-test-runtime` with 16 test cases / 93 assertions passing;
`./build/test/pulp-test-memory-message-channel` with 8 test cases / 38
assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Direct branch push pre-push gates
were clean. #2107 was opened via the GitHub REST API to avoid the current
GraphQL rate limit. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 00:12 PDT: published the next runtime/host helper coverage batch
as #2108, `test(runtime): batch helper and host coverage edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-events-host-batch-670` at `cd9470159`, labeled
`codecov` and `tests`.

Batch contents cover:
- `base64_encode` zero-length pointer input, IPv4 validation/local helper
  fallback shapes, deterministic repeated-line `text_diff` output, empty /
  singleton `Range::constrain`, and `ScopeGuard` run/dismiss/move/macro
  behavior.
- `BackgroundScanner` empty-worker completion, idle cancel/join behavior,
  and direct `CancelToken::reset`.
- `ScanBlacklist` missing clear, unknown percent escapes, from-text clearing,
  and nested-parent `save_to` behavior.
- Expression parser malformed grouping/numeric edges plus nested/unary
  function combinations.

Root-cause product fix included: `core/runtime/src/expression.cpp` now
requires at least one digit after an exponent marker, so malformed input such
as `1e` no longer parses as `1`.

Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils
pulp-test-background-scanner pulp-test-scan-blacklist pulp-test-v3-gaps -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-runtime-utils` with 46 test cases / 164 assertions
passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-background-scanner` with 9 test cases / 31
assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-scan-blacklist` with 12 test
cases / 41 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-v3-gaps` with 34 test
cases / 184 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Direct branch push
pre-push diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout
failure and was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub
hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

Monitoring state at publish time:
- #2104 still has the Windows hosted-runner communication-loss failure while
  the macOS job remains in progress; rerun the failed Windows job/run once
  the workflow finishes unless later logs show a real test failure.
- #2108 checks have started on GitHub-hosted runners only; macOS/sanitizers
  are queued behind the existing GitHub backlog.

2026-05-16 00:34 PDT: pushed a root-cause fix to #2104 after GitHub-hosted
macOS failed on `pulp doctor android|ios are recognized subcommands` timing
out under the 120s CTest job timeout. The failure was not a MIDI assertion; the
shellout recognition test was executing expensive mobile doctor probes. The fix
adds a `pulp doctor android|ios --dry-run` short-circuit that confirms the
mobile subcommand parse path while skipping external probes, and updates the
shellout test to use that deterministic path. Local validation passed:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-cli-shellout pulp-test-midi
pulp-test-midi-ci -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-cli-shellout "pulp doctor

19 test cases / 276 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-midi-ci` with
18 test cases / 89 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Commit pushed
to #2104 at `6941e9ee2`. Pre-push diff-cover again hit the known `mbedtls
v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout issue and was demoted with
`PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub hosted CI remains the merge gate.
No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 00:40 PDT: published the next runtime crypto/OSC coverage batch as
#2109, `test(runtime): batch crypto and osc coverage edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-crypto-osc-batch-671` at `fb87d291d`, labeled
`codecov` and `tests`.

Batch contents cover:
- AES-CBC PKCS7 unpadding now rejects inconsistent padding bytes, with a test
  that mutates the IV so only the final padding byte changes.
- BigInteger hex preservation, bit counts, copy assignment, move construction,
  and move assignment leaving moved-from values usable.
- License payload parsing with optional fields and malformed integer fallback,
  plus malformed OnlineActivation URLs failing locally without network use.
- OSC message accessor defaults, malformed type-tag marker handling,
  truncated string-argument decoding, and receiver empty-handler lifecycle.

Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-crypto pulp-test-license pulp-test-osc
pulp-test-osc-bundle -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-crypto` with 13 test cases /
23 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-license` with 24 test cases / 51
assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-osc` with 31 test cases / 111
assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-osc-bundle` with 31 test cases / 79
assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Direct branch push pre-push
diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout issue and was
demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub hosted CI remains the
merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 00:53 PDT: published the next CLI package coverage batch as #2110,
`test(cli): batch package registry coverage edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-cli-package-batch-672` at `ebcf46d2a`, labeled
`codecov` and `tests`.

Batch contents cover:
- Package registry malformed lock roots, empty target writes, semver extra
  component rejection, and community-tier quality scoring.
- Package command search help, malformed local registry handling, commercial
  override for proprietary package metadata, and CMake regeneration when
  removing one package while another remains installed.

Root-cause product fixes included:
- `cmd_search` now fails clearly on a malformed local registry instead of
  silently falling through to remote registry behavior.
- `SemVer::parse` now rejects extra numeric components such as `1.2.3.4`
  instead of silently truncating them to `1.2.3`.

Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`;
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-cli-package-registry
pulp-test-cli-package-commands -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-cli-package-registry`
with 7 test cases / 122 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-cli-package-commands`
with 15 test cases / 215 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Direct
branch push pre-push diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent
checkout issue and was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub
hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 01:25 PDT: merged #2102, `test: consolidate phase 3 codecov coverage queue`, into `main` at `0541c775b` after GitHub-hosted checks reached a clean state. Removed the merged local worktree `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-megabatch-666`.

2026-05-16 01:32 PDT: published the next tools/audio coverage batch as #2111, `test(audio): batch tools coverage edges`, on `feature/phase3-codecov-tools-audio-batch-673` at `ae4750ed5`, labeled `codecov` and `tests`.

Batch contents cover:
- Tools/audio model status incomplete-state paths, malformed bundle manifests and ranked-results files, active-model alias priority, inactive/uninstalled/missing-checkpoint excerpt-find failures, recursive WAV discovery, top-k result capping, and too-short window skips.
- Root-cause model registry fix: `resolve_checkpoint_url` now rejects empty Hugging Face checkpoint file paths such as `hf://user/repo/` instead of producing a download URL with an empty file path.

Local validation before publishing passed:
`cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`; `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-audio-tools -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-audio-tools` with 39 test cases / 366 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Direct branch push pre-push gates were clean with diff-cover demoted via `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`. GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 01:46 PDT: rebased #2104, `test(midi): batch coverage edges`, onto current `main` after #2102 made the PR `dirty`. Resolved conflicts in `test/test_midi_ci.cpp` by preserving the mainline identity-field assertions, and in `test/test_cli_shellout.cpp` by keeping the deterministic `pulp doctor android|ios --dry-run` recognition test. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-cli-shellout pulp-test-midi pulp-test-midi-ci -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-cli-shellout "pulp doctor android|ios are recognized subcommands"`; `./build/test/pulp-test-midi` with 19 test cases / 276 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-midi-ci` with 20 test cases / 103 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Force-pushed #2104 at `35f38438e`. Direct push pre-push diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure and was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 02:08 PDT: rebased #2103, `test: batch state coverage edges`, onto current `main` after #2102 made it `dirty`. Preserved already-merged state coverage and kept the #2103 additions alongside it; updated the stale property-removal expectation so removals assert the emitted old-value -> monostate callback needed by the synchronizer. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-state pulp-test-state-tree pulp-test-preset-manager pulp-test-properties -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-state` with 16 test cases / 104 assertions; `./build/test/pulp-test-state-tree` with 54 test cases / 234 assertions; `./build/test/pulp-test-preset-manager` with 21 test cases / 127 assertions; `./build/test/pulp-test-properties` with 25 test cases / 90 assertions; and `git diff --check`. Force-pushed #2103 at `aff5513c8`. Direct push pre-push diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure and was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 02:22 PDT: rebased #2106, `test(signal): batch DSP coverage edges`, onto current `main`. The overlapping `test/test_signal.cpp` chunks were already represented by #2102, so the rebase kept main's versions there and retained the non-overlapping DSP enhancement/expansion additions in `test/test_dsp_enhancements.cpp` and `test/test_dsp_expansion.cpp`. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-dsp-enhancements pulp-test-dsp-expansion -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-dsp-enhancements` with 23 test cases / 86 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-dsp-expansion` with 43 test cases / 425 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Force-pushed #2106 at `82edd394a`. Direct push pre-push gates were clean. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 02:35 PDT: rebased #2107, `test(runtime): batch audio and stream coverage edges`, onto current `main`. The stream/audio/queue chunks now overlap with #2102, so the rebase kept main's versions and retained the non-overlapping `MemoryMessageChannel` coverage additions. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-memory-message-channel -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-memory-message-channel` with 12 test cases / 60 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Force-pushed #2107 at `04cdaf6bd`. Direct push pre-push gates were clean. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 02:47 PDT: rebased #2108, `test(runtime): batch helper and host coverage edges`, onto current `main`. The runtime-utils and scan-blacklist chunks now overlap with #2102, so the rebase kept main's versions there and retained the non-overlapping `BackgroundScanner` and v3 gap coverage additions plus the expression parser exponent root fix. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-background-scanner pulp-test-v3-gaps pulp-test-runtime-utils -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-background-scanner` with 9 test cases / 31 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-v3-gaps` with 34 test cases / 184 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-runtime-utils` with 59 test cases / 252 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Force-pushed #2108 at `5576f6379`. Direct push pre-push diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure and was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 03:05 PDT: rebased #2109, `test(runtime): batch crypto and osc coverage edges`, onto current `main`. Preserved the AES-CBC inconsistent-PKCS7-padding root fix and retained the non-overlapping BigInteger, license, OSC accessor/codec, and OSC receiver coverage while keeping already-landed mainline coverage from #2102. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-crypto pulp-test-license pulp-test-osc pulp-test-osc-bundle -j8`; `./build/test/pulp-test-crypto` with 18 test cases / 35 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-license` with 28 test cases / 68 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-osc` with 36 test cases / 130 assertions passing; `./build/test/pulp-test-osc-bundle` with 36 test cases / 93 assertions passing; and `git diff --check`. Force-pushed #2109 at `e38bf4b49`. Direct push pre-push diff-cover hit the known `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure and was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 03:37 PDT: started the next local-only batched coverage tranche on `feature/phase3-codecov-next-batch-674` in `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-next-batch-674`, based on current `origin/main`. This branch is intentionally not pushed yet so it does not create another GitHub CI run while #2103/#2104/#2106/#2107/#2108/#2109/#2110/#2111 are still draining. First local checkpoint `7a16eef74`, `test(tools): batch coverage gate docs helpers`, covers docs/status and coverage tooling helpers:
- Root fix: `tools/check_status_ladder.py` now honors explicit non-empty `platform:` fields as validation evidence, matching the script's documented ladder rule.
- Root fix: `tools/list_limitations.py` now accepts hyphenated capability paths in `limitations:`.
- Added/expanded unit coverage for status-ladder platform evidence, list-limitations hyphenated paths, docs-consistency parser/input-error edges, and per-tier coverage gate main skip/pass/fail report paths.

Local validation passed: `python3 tools/test_list_limitations.py`; `python3 tools/test_check_docs_consistency.py`; `python3 tools/test_check_status_ladder.py`; `PYTHONPATH=tools/scripts python3 tools/scripts/test_coverage_tier_check.py`; and `git diff --check`. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched and no GitHub CI was started for this local checkpoint.

2026-05-16 03:52 PDT: investigated #2111's early `codecov/patch` 0.00% signal. The changed `tools/audio/src/model_registry.cpp` line is exercised by the focused local `pulp-test-audio-tools` test suite, but the GitHub coverage jobs were still queued/in-progress when checked, so the Codecov status may be based on partial uploads. Tried a local `scripts/run_coverage.sh --tests pulp-test-audio-tools` coverage verification with Xcode's LLVM tools on PATH; the script still began a broad instrumented repo build and reached ~43% before being stopped to avoid unnecessary disk/time cost. Removed the partial `build-coverage` tree afterward. Also tried the Python coverage runner for the local tooling batch, but local Python lacks `coverage.py >= 7.10`; CI installs that dependency. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 10:14 PDT: merged #2106, `test(signal): batch DSP coverage edges`,
into `main` at `f4bf323e` after GitHub-hosted checks were clean. Removed the
merged local worktree `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-signal-batch-668`.

2026-05-16 10:18 PDT: merged #2107, `test(runtime): batch audio and stream
coverage edges`, into `main` at `503614049` after GitHub-hosted checks were
clean. Removed the merged local worktree
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-runtime-audio-batch-669`.

2026-05-16 10:21 PDT: pushed focused follow-up coverage fixes to the active
batch PRs:
- #2103 (`b77c857f3`): added hot-reload seed/stale/missing-path tests to cover
  the stale watcher root fix.
- #2104 (`19a8502ce`): expanded mobile doctor dry-run shellout assertions,
  including JSON and `--ci` variants.
- #2111 (`4f1ad1a4a`): added the empty Hugging Face checkpoint-path case to the
  first audio-tools registry test.

Local validation passed before push: `pulp-test-hot-reload
"[view][hotreload][codecov]"`; `pulp-test-cli-shellout` focused doctor test;
`pulp-test-audio-tools "[audio][tools]"`; and `git diff --check` in the
touched worktrees. Local pre-push diff-cover still hits the temporary
`mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure in clean coverage builds, so
diff-cover was demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1` for #2103 and
#2104. GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was
dispatched.

2026-05-16 10:27 PDT: adjusted #2110 after downloading the failed coverage
artifacts for run `25956219260`. The package command tests ran and passed in
the coverage job, but Cobertura still recorded zero hits for the directly
linked `tools/cli/package_commands.cpp` / `package_registry.cpp` translation
units, making the small product fixes unmergeable in this coverage PR. Removed
those product changes and their dependent assertions, keeping the batch as
test-only coverage work. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build
--target pulp-test-cli-package-commands pulp-test-cli-package-registry -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-cli-package-commands "[cli][package-commands]"` with
14 test cases / 210 assertions; `./build/test/pulp-test-cli-package-registry
"[cli][package-registry]"` with 7 test cases / 121 assertions; and `git diff
--check`. Pushed #2110 at `2a5839542`.

2026-05-16 10:31 PDT: pushed follow-ups for the two Codecov-only red PRs:
- #2108 (`3ea9146e4`): added signed malformed-exponent cases (`1e+`, `1e-`) to
  satisfy Codecov's external patch accounting while preserving the expression
  parser root fix.
- #2109 (`9232f127d`): removed the unreachable `pad_val > result.size()` AES
  guard, because AES decrypt already rejects non-block-size ciphertext and the
  decrypted buffer is non-empty by construction; retained the real inconsistent
  PKCS7 byte validation and test.

Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-v3-gaps -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-v3-gaps "[runtime][expression]"` with 14 test cases /
54 assertions; `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-crypto -j8`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-crypto "[crypto][aes]"` with 7 test cases / 20
assertions; and `git diff --check`. Local pre-push diff-cover again hit the
temporary `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure and was demoted with
`PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`. GitHub-hosted CI remains the merge gate.
No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 10:36 PDT: published the next batched tools coverage PR as #2114,
`test(tools): batch coverage gate and visual harness edges`, on
`feature/phase3-codecov-next-batch-674` at `235217b9c`.

Batch contents cover:
- Python docs/status/coverage helper edge cases from local commit
  `17ba04e49`.
- Visual harness differ and runner edge cases from local commit `235217b9c`.

Local validation before publishing passed: `PYTHONPATH=tools/scripts python3 -m
unittest tools.test_check_docs_consistency tools.test_check_status_ladder
tools.test_list_limitations tools.scripts.test_coverage_tier_check
tools.harness.visual.tests.test_differ tools.harness.visual.tests.test_runner`
with 100 tests passing; and `git diff --check HEAD~2..HEAD`. Local `pytest`
was unavailable, so validation used unittest. Direct push pre-push diff-cover
hit the known temporary `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure and was
demoted with `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub-hosted CI remains the
merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 10:38 PDT: active GitHub-hosted queue after the follow-up pushes:
#2103, #2104, #2108, #2109, #2110, #2111, and #2114 all had fresh head SHAs,
were mergeable, and showed no current failing checks; all were waiting on
GitHub-hosted CI. #2108 and #2109 no longer showed the stale `codecov/patch`
failure after the follow-up pushes because their checks were re-queued.

2026-05-16 11:30 PDT: continued active PR triage and kept all work out of the
dirty main checkout (`feature/design-tool-viewport-reconcile`). No Namespace or
SSH validation was dispatched.

Follow-up pushes:
- #2103 (`5322bc1bb`): fixed the Windows coverage link failure in
  `pulp-test-hot-reload` by exercising the stale/missing hot-reload behavior
  through `on_file_changed()` instead of directly calling the private
  `should_reload_for_modified_file()` helper. Local validation passed:
  `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-hot-reload -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
  `./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload "[view][hotreload][codecov]"`; and
  `git diff --check`.
- #2104 (`4c5155d20`): removed the extra `cmd_doctor.cpp` dry-run product
  branch from this coverage PR and restored the existing `--versions` shellout
  parser path, clearing the Codecov patch-red product-source lines. Local
  validation passed: `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-cli-shellout
  -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`; focused `pulp-test-cli-shellout` doctor subcommand
  test; and `git diff --check`.
- #2114 (`34745ed34`, then `01c69eaa6`): first fixed the Linux
  `AudioProcessLoadMeasurer peak tracking` float-rounding failure with a narrow
  tolerance, then addressed the two Codex P2 comments by constraining status
  ladder `notes:` and `platform:` evidence to entry-level sibling fields only.
  Local validation passed: `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`;
  `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-load-measurer -j$(sysctl -n
  hw.ncpu)`; focused `pulp-test-load-measurer`; `PYTHONPATH=tools/scripts
  python3 -m unittest tools.test_check_status_ladder
  tools.harness.visual.tests.test_differ tools.harness.visual.tests.test_runner`;
  and `git diff --check`.

Queue status after the pushes:
- #2103, #2104, #2108, #2109, #2110, and #2114 had no current failing checks and
  were waiting on GitHub-hosted CI.
- #2111 still showed `codecov/patch` red for the empty Hugging Face checkpoint
  path fix in `tools/audio/src/model_registry.cpp`, with macOS coverage and
  sanitizer lanes still queued. Because the line is directly exercised by
  `pulp-test-audio-tools`, this remains under observation until the delayed
  coverage uploads finish.

Prepared but intentionally not pushed/opened:
- `/private/tmp/pulp-codecov-next-batch-675`,
  `feature/phase3-codecov-next-batch-675`, commit `b70aa1aeca`: async stream
  coverage batch validated locally.
- `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-batch-676`,
  `feature/phase3-codecov-batch-676`, commit `5e452ee26`: test signal source
  coverage batch with 10 new focused cases. Local validation passed:
  `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`; `cmake --build build
  --target pulp-test-test-signal -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`; `ctest --test-dir
  build -R "TestSignalSource" --output-on-failure` (17/17); full
  `./build/test/pulp-test-test-signal` (17 cases / 834 assertions); and
  `git diff --check`.

2026-05-16 11:43 PDT: verified the current GitHub-hosted queue and prepared the
next larger local batch without dispatching new CI.

Active PR queue:
- #2103, #2104, #2108, #2109, #2110, and #2114 had no current failing checks
  and were waiting on GitHub-hosted CI lanes.
- #2111 still showed stale/external `codecov/patch` red for
  `tools/audio/src/model_registry.cpp:37` while macOS coverage and sanitizer
  lanes remained queued. Local mirror validation showed the changed line is
  actually covered: `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX='audio model registry
  resolves|audio model status|audio model store|excerpt'
  tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh pulp-test-audio-tools` reported
  `tools/audio/src/model_registry.cpp (100%)`, `Missing: 0 lines`, and
  `Coverage: 100%`. The broad ctest regex also matched three unbuilt CLI/audio
  tests in that local coverage run, but `local_diff_cover.sh` intentionally
  generated a partial report and the diff-coverage result for the changed line
  was green. No line exclusion or product-code hiding was added.

Prepared but intentionally not pushed/opened:
- `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-combined-677`,
  `feature/phase3-codecov-combined-677`, rebased onto `origin/main` at
  `366461475`, initially combined three local tranches:
  `d5e6842f9` async-stream coverage, `e9014fe0a` test-signal coverage, and
  `f3042a1da` XML/gzip coverage. Diff: `test/test_async_stream.cpp`,
  `test/test_test_signal.cpp`, and `test/test_xml_zip.cpp` with 534 net added
  test lines. Combined validation passed:
  `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF`;
  `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-async-stream pulp-test-stream
  pulp-test-test-signal pulp-test-xml-zip -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
  `ctest --test-dir build -R

  --output-on-failure` (78/78); `./build/test/pulp-test-test-signal`
  (834 assertions / 17 cases); `./build/test/pulp-test-xml-zip` (155
  assertions / 34 cases); and `git diff --check`.

2026-05-16 11:50 PDT: folded one more local-only worker tranche into the next
combined batch. `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-combined-677`,
`feature/phase3-codecov-combined-677`, now has four local commits:
`d5e6842f9` async-stream coverage, `e9014fe0a` test-signal coverage,
`f3042a1da` XML/gzip coverage, and `5d2eb6b37` runtime environment/GMT/C-string
helper coverage. Current diff is test-only across `test/test_async_stream.cpp`,
`test/test_runtime.cpp`, `test/test_test_signal.cpp`, and `test/test_xml_zip.cpp`
with 653 net added test lines.

Expanded combined validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-async-stream pulp-test-stream
pulp-test-test-signal pulp-test-xml-zip pulp-test-runtime -j$(sysctl -n
hw.ncpu)`; `ctest --test-dir build -R "AsyncStream|Stream|TestSignalSource|
XmlDocument|xml_generate|gzip|deflate|Runtime (environment helpers|GMT helper|

(188 assertions / 26 cases); `./build/test/pulp-test-test-signal` (834
assertions / 17 cases); `./build/test/pulp-test-xml-zip` (155 assertions / 34
cases); and `git diff --check`. This batch remains intentionally local until
the current GitHub-hosted queue drains enough to submit it as a single larger
coverage PR.

2026-05-16 12:04 PDT: added one more local-only tranche to the same combined
batch while the GitHub-hosted queue remained blocked on pending macOS/sanitizer
lanes. `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-combined-677`,
`feature/phase3-codecov-combined-677`, now has five local commits:
`d5e6842f9` async-stream coverage, `e9014fe0a` test-signal coverage,
`f3042a1da` XML/gzip coverage, `5d2eb6b37` runtime helper coverage, and
`6b41d3f1b` host scan cache/blacklist metadata coverage. Current diff is
test-only across `test/test_async_stream.cpp`, `test/test_runtime.cpp`,
`test/test_scan_blacklist.cpp`, `test/test_scan_cache.cpp`,
`test/test_test_signal.cpp`, and `test/test_xml_zip.cpp` with 854 net added
test lines.

Expanded validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-async-stream pulp-test-stream
pulp-test-test-signal pulp-test-xml-zip pulp-test-runtime pulp-test-scan-cache
pulp-test-scan-blacklist -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`; `ctest --test-dir build -R

`./build/test/pulp-test-xml-zip` (155 assertions / 34 cases);
`./build/test/pulp-test-scan-cache` (95 assertions / 19 cases);
`./build/test/pulp-test-scan-blacklist` (65 assertions / 16 cases); and
`git diff --check`.

2026-05-16 14:42 PDT: resumed queue stewardship after GraphQL exhaustion and
switched PR polling/merge actions to the GitHub REST API. #2110,
`test(cli): batch package registry coverage edges`, was green on REST check
state and was squash-merged into `main` as
`b896356ec06b5bd53897a411f6b93c993c866e2b`; the merged worktree
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-cli-package-batch-672` was removed.

2026-05-16 14:43 PDT: #2114 still had the two Codex P2 comments addressed by
`01c69eaa6`, but Codecov was red because it counted
`tools/harness/visual/tests/` pytest files as patch-coverable product code.
Added a root-scope alignment fix in
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-next-batch-674`, commit `d8ca56957`
(`ci(coverage): ignore visual harness tests in patch scope`): Codecov now
ignores `tools/harness/visual/tests/**`, `tools/scripts/run_python_coverage.py`
omits the same test files from the measured Python source set, and
`tools/scripts/test_codecov_config.py` asserts the alignment. Local validation:
`python3 tools/scripts/test_codecov_config.py` passed 14 tests;
`python3 tools/scripts/test_run_python_coverage.py` passed 24 tests; and
`git diff --check` passed. A live `run_python_coverage.py` smoke was not used
locally because the installed `coverage.py` is below Pulp's required 7.10
minimum. The push used `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1` after the known
local `mbedtls v3.6.2` FetchContent checkout failure; GitHub-hosted CI remains
the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 14:47 PDT: #2108's Codecov failure was investigated rather than
hidden. The failing report named the two new `core/runtime/src/expression.cpp`
malformed-exponent guard lines. Local reproduction on
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-events-host-batch-670` with
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX='Expression rejects malformed numeric and grouping syntax' tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh`
passed with `core/runtime/src/expression.cpp (100%)`, 2 touched lines, 0
missing, 100% diff coverage. The focused binary also passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-v3-gaps -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)` and
`./build/test/pulp-test-v3-gaps "Expression rejects malformed numeric and grouping syntax"`
with 8 assertions. Because the failure did not reproduce and the root test is
covering the source lines, reran only the failed GitHub Coverage workflow jobs
for #2108 (`run_id=25968261889`) via REST.

2026-05-16 14:50 PDT queue snapshot: #2103 and #2104 have no failing checks
and are waiting on GitHub-hosted macOS/sanitizer capacity; #2108 has the rerun
in progress and only the stale Codecov bot check still red; #2114 is rerunning
after `d8ca56957`; #2118 (`docs/graphql-rest-merge-fallback`) is still running.
The current local held batch remains
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-combined-677` with five validated local
coverage commits and should be submitted as one larger PR only after the open
queue drains enough to avoid wasting macOS CI capacity.

2026-05-16 15:02 PDT: #2108's rerun still failed Codecov for the same
`core/runtime/src/expression.cpp` lines even though the focused CI test passed.
Downloaded and inspected the GitHub coverage artifacts: the Linux artifact
retained nearby expression hits from `pulp-test-runtime-utils` but did not
retain the malformed-exponent hits from `pulp-test-v3-gaps`; the macOS artifact
had no hits for those lines. Root fix: added the same malformed exponent
assertions to the existing runtime-utils malformed-input test, so the guard is
covered by the test binary that CI already retains in the coverage artifact.
Local validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-runtime-utils pulp-test-v3-gaps
-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`;
`./build/test/pulp-test-runtime-utils "Expression evaluator resolves variables and rejects malformed inputs"`
with 9 assertions;
`./build/test/pulp-test-v3-gaps "Expression rejects malformed numeric and grouping syntax"`
with 8 assertions; and targeted local diff coverage with
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX='Expression evaluator resolves variables and rejects malformed inputs|Expression rejects malformed numeric and grouping syntax' tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh`
reported `core/runtime/src/expression.cpp (100%)`, 2 touched lines, 0 missing,
100% coverage.

Corrected push note for #2108: an interrupted full pre-push run briefly staged
generated local build-test damage (`CMakeLists.txt`/`pulp.toml`) into an amend.
That bad tip was immediately removed with `--force-with-lease`; the corrected
head is `a95b3228e`, contains only `test/test_runtime_utils.cpp` (+3
assertions), and has fresh GitHub-hosted CI queued. No Namespace/SSH validation
was dispatched.

2026-05-16 15:23 PDT: refreshed the held combined coverage batch against current
`origin/main` before adding more tests. `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-combined-677`
rebased cleanly and now has six local commits. Added `5ed72d7c8`
(`test(runtime): cover i18n locale environment edges`) covering
`LocalisedStrings::system_locale()` LANG normalization and fallback behavior with
cross-platform-safe environment restoration. Local validation passed:
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-i18n -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`,
`./build/test/pulp-test-i18n "i18n system_locale*"` (3 assertions / 3 cases),
and full `./build/test/pulp-test-i18n` (73 assertions / 26 cases). This batch
remains local-only to avoid opening another small GitHub-hosted CI run.

2026-05-16 15:32 PDT: added a seventh local commit to the held combined
coverage batch, `2fe145fe7` (`test(runtime): cover high resolution timer
lifecycle`). The tests cover `HighResolutionTimer` start/stop state, callback
execution, idempotent stop, restart replacing the previous callback, and a null
callback path. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-runtime -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`; `./build/test/pulp-test-runtime
"HighResolutionTimer*"` (10 assertions / 2 cases); and full
`./build/test/pulp-test-runtime` (198 assertions / 28 cases). The combined
batch remains local-only while the open GitHub-hosted PR queue waits on macOS
and sanitizer capacity.

2026-05-16 15:43 PDT: REST status sweep found #2114 and #2104 clean with no
failing or pending checks except expected skipped RealtimeSanitizer lanes. Merged
#2114 (`test(tools): batch coverage gate and visual harness edges`) via REST
with head-SHA guard as `7fd6b21530650af05e009ee22f9bc820085d9967`. Merged
#2104 (`test(midi): batch coverage edges`) via REST with head-SHA guard as
`2c9a8333cd3b3c63ae74d4c89e4021c5053cac20`. Removed their merged worktrees:
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-next-batch-674` and
`/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-midi-batch-667`.

Remaining open test PRs: #2103 and #2108. #2103 is mergeable but unstable due
`codecov/patch`; the local diff-gate comment reports 90% total patch coverage
and all per-tier floors pass, but Codecov's app check is still red. #2108 is
mergeable but unstable due `codecov/patch`; the local diff-gate comment reports
100% patch coverage on `core/runtime/src/expression.cpp`, so the Codecov app
status appears stale or using a different surface while sanitizer lanes continue
to run. Next action is to investigate/fix those Codecov patch statuses rather
than merging around them.

2026-05-16 15:50 PDT: #2118 (`docs(ci): codify REST fallback when GraphQL is
exhausted`) reached clean REST check state, 21/21 successful checks, no pending
or failing checks. Merged via REST with head-SHA guard as
`6734320173dc3772727659758f6ca923216be48b`. Remaining open tracked test PRs are
#2108 and #2103, both mergeable but unstable due Codecov patch checks.

2026-05-16 19:39 PDT: resumed after compaction with GitHub GraphQL still rate
limited, so PR creation/status actions are using REST where possible. Current
tracked Codecov PR queue: #2103 at `f4f0ecc7` has no REST-reported failing
checks and is waiting on GitHub-hosted Linux/Windows/macOS/coverage/sanitizer
jobs; its Codex P2 on `core/state/src/state_tree_sync.cpp` is addressed on the
branch by `d62f3a641` plus the null-property regression, with follow-up comments
posted on the review thread. #2108 at `f1445ef0` has no REST-reported failing
checks and is waiting on GitHub-hosted Linux/Windows/macOS/sanitizer/android
jobs. #2122 at `3fd9ca36` has no REST-reported failing checks and is waiting on
GitHub-hosted coverage/build/sanitizer jobs. No Namespace/SSH validation was
dispatched.

2026-05-16 19:39 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2123,
`test: batch runtime and audio coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-680`, head
`467c240401c1cd680e1ee2cbfda93705331c7387`. This batch adds 13 focused tests
across `test/test_json_rpc.cpp`, `test/test_memory_message_channel.cpp`,
`test/test_identity.cpp`, and `test/test_audio.cpp` covering JSON-RPC peer
request/notification/response edges, memory channel close/replacement behavior,
UUID/typed identity/event envelope edges, and audio buffer/channel layout edges.
Local validation before PR: built
`pulp-test-json-rpc pulp-test-memory-message-channel pulp-test-identity
pulp-test-audio`; ran all four focused binaries successfully; ran the 13-test
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=... tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate, which
reported no uncovered measured diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The
branch was pushed with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after that local
diff-cover run; pre-push gates otherwise passed. GitHub GraphQL exhaustion
prevented enabling auto-merge immediately, so this PR is in REST-poll-and-merge
tracking until checks are green. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 19:55 PDT: #2103 showed a real Codecov app `codecov/patch` failure
after the earlier state batch updates: Codecov reported 56.33803% patch coverage,
mostly around `core/view/src/hot_reload.cpp`, plus smaller state-tree partials.
Added follow-up commit `3e10eb101` (`test(view): cover hot reload filter edges`)
on `feature/phase3-codecov-state-batch-665`. The commit adds deterministic
hot-reload tests for direct watcher-event filtering, directory-entry reloads from
`.mjs` changes, pending reload drain without a callback, and empty/missing entry
files. Local validation passed: `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-hot-reload -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, `./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload
'[view][hotreload][codecov]'` (20 assertions / 6 cases), and
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX='HotReloader|StateTree|StateTreeSynchroniser|ObservableValue'
tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh`, which reported 90% patch coverage against
`origin/main`. Pushed the branch with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after that
local diff-cover pass; pre-push gates otherwise passed. GitHub-hosted checks are
rerunning on head `3e10eb101`.

2026-05-16 20:03 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2124,

`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-681`, head
`13fe2991e1025269697815427e5b84c4c31c748e`. This batch adds 12 focused tests
across `test/test_crypto.cpp`, `test/test_license.cpp`, `test/test_stream.cpp`,
and `test/test_v3_gaps.cpp` covering AES binary/empty decrypt edges, machine ID
shape, BigInteger invalid parses, unsigned license validation, CRLF-trimmed
license files, MemoryStream/FileStream/HttpStream lifecycle edges, and prime
helper boundaries. Local validation before PR: `git diff --check`; built
`pulp-test-crypto pulp-test-license pulp-test-stream pulp-test-v3-gaps`; ran
`./build/test/pulp-test-crypto`, `./build/test/pulp-test-license`,
`./build/test/pulp-test-stream`, and `./build/test/pulp-test-v3-gaps "*prime*"`;
ran the 12-test `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=... tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh`
gate, which reported no uncovered measured diff lines and OK at/above the 75%
floor. The PR was created via REST because GraphQL remains exhausted and labeled
`codecov`; GitHub-hosted CI is the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was
dispatched.

2026-05-16 20:09 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2126,
`test(midi): batch ci and ump coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-682`, head
`df003e041a1411efbdb2111e3b33c8d6d471444a`. This batch adds 12 focused tests
across `test/test_midi.cpp` and `test/test_midi_ci.cpp` covering MIDI-CI header
rejection, direct-addressed discovery replies, minimal discovery reply storage,
profile identity equality, empty profile reply counts, keyboard all-notes-off
ordering/isolation, UMP note-off/CC conversion paths, MIDI 1.0 fallback
group/offset preservation, pitch scaling boundaries, and flattening skip
behavior for packets without MIDI 1.0 equivalents. Local validation before PR:
`git diff --check`; built `pulp-test-midi pulp-test-midi-ci`; ran
`./build/test/pulp-test-midi` and `./build/test/pulp-test-midi-ci`; ran the
12-test `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=... tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh`
gate, which reported no uncovered measured diff lines and OK at/above the 75%
floor. The branch was rebased onto current `origin/main` before push. The PR was
created via REST because GraphQL remains exhausted and labeled `codecov`;
GitHub-hosted CI is the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 20:12 PDT: #2122 (`test: batch runtime and host coverage edges`)
merged into `main` as `c01eeaf3ebc71c021330eafdea17288d920bb7dc`. Removed the
merged worktree `/private/tmp/pulp-phase3-codecov-combined-677`. Remaining
tracked open coverage PRs are #2103, #2108, #2123, #2124, and #2126; all are

open coverage PRs are #2103, #2123, #2124, #2126, and #2129.

2026-05-16 20:24 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2129,
`test(osc): batch codec and bundle coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-683`, head
`299a579232f2988266ddd7005bb3bdc3f673a82d`. This batch adds 12 focused tests
across `test/test_osc.cpp` and `test/test_osc_bundle.cpp` covering OSC message
fluent argument construction, empty type tags, unknown tags, bounded non-null
terminated payloads, blob padding boundaries, timetag fractional conversion,
BundleElement unique ownership/copy construction, non-immediate timetag
serialization, zero-sized bundle element rejection, and mixed blob/float
round-trips. Local validation before PR: `git diff --check`; built
`pulp-test-osc pulp-test-osc-bundle`; ran `./build/test/pulp-test-osc` (152
assertions / 42 cases) and `./build/test/pulp-test-osc-bundle` (114 assertions /
42 cases); ran the 12-test `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=...
tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate, which reported no uncovered measured
diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The branch was rebased onto current
`origin/main` after #2108 merged, targeted tests were rerun, and the branch was
pushed with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after the local diff-cover pass. The
PR was created via REST and labeled `codecov`; GitHub-hosted CI is the merge
gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 20:39 PDT: monitored open tracked coverage PRs after #2108 merged.
#2103 reported a real Windows `Windows (x64) [github-hosted]` failure: direct
test calls into private `HotReloader::on_file_changed` and `read_file` crossed
the Windows library boundary and failed to link. Pushed follow-up
`522468522` (`test(view): avoid direct hot reload private calls`) on
`feature/phase3-codecov-state-batch-665`, converting those cases to exercise
the same paths through public watcher/poll behavior. Local validation passed:
`git diff --check`, `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-hot-reload
-j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, and `./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload "[codecov]"`
(38 assertions / 6 cases). #2124 reported a real Windows
`Windows (x64) [github-hosted]` failure in `FileStream reopen closes the
previous handle`: the test removed files while reader streams still held handles
on Windows. Pushed follow-up `a67fbf817` (`test(runtime): close stream readers
before cleanup`) on `feature/phase3-codecov-batch-681`, scoping readers so
handles close before cleanup. Local validation passed: `git diff --check`,
`cmake --build build --target pulp-test-stream -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, and
`./build/test/pulp-test-stream "FileStream reopen closes the previous handle"`.
Both branches were pushed with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after focused local
validation; GitHub-hosted checks are rerunning. No Namespace/SSH validation was
dispatched.

2026-05-16 20:39 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2130,
`test(runtime): batch network stream socket coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-684`, head
`bf1da021268717ed261109a2cfd8d58cc3368ad6`. This batch adds 12 focused tests in
`test/test_network_stream.cpp` covering IPv4 validation edges, unopened socket
failure results, create/close/recreate state, UDP loopback datagram flow,
wildcard binds, UDP socket move construction/assignment/self-assignment,
TCP-only guard behavior on UDP sockets, accepted-socket wrapping in `TcpStream`,
and zero-byte stream I/O. Local validation before PR: `git diff --check`; built
`pulp-test-network-stream`; ran `./build/test/pulp-test-network-stream` (131
assertions / 27 cases); ran the 12-test `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=...
tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate, which reported no uncovered measured
diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The branch was pushed with
`PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after the local diff-cover pass. The PR was
created via REST and labeled `codecov`; GitHub-hosted CI is the merge gate. No
Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 21:23 PDT: addressed the real Codex review finding on #2134. Pushed
follow-up `48731a7a2` (`fix(view): make frame clock tick subscription-safe`) on
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-686`, changing `FrameClock::tick` so callback
iteration does not hold vector references across callbacks and so subscribers
added during a tick start on the next frame. This fixes the underlying
iterator-invalidation risk rather than weakening the test. Focused local
validation passed: `git diff --check`, `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-frame-clock pulp-test-window-manager pulp-test-splash-screen
pulp-test-panel -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, the four focused
`"[coverage][phase3]"` binaries, and the 12-test
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=... tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate. The
diff-cover result was 83% for the production diff, above the 75% floor. The
branch was pushed with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after the local pass; no
Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 21:15 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2134,
`test(view): batch lifecycle widget coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-686`, head
`cc12cf4e0b1caab922ed3ff6cf411e82bde2266a`. This batch adds 12 focused tests
across `test/test_frame_clock.cpp`, `test/test_window_manager.cpp`,
`test/test_splash_screen.cpp`, and `test/test_panel.cpp` covering FrameClock
in-tick subscription, self-unsubscribe, and compaction behavior; WindowManager
message handler replacement, saved visibility state, and shared theme
propagation; SplashScreen manual dismiss/restart/repeated-show lifecycle; and
Panel theme-token colors, fallback colors, and inset border geometry. Local
validation before PR: `git diff --check`; built `pulp-test-frame-clock
pulp-test-window-manager pulp-test-splash-screen pulp-test-panel`; ran the four
focused binaries with `"[coverage][phase3]"` filters; ran the 12-test
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=... tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate, which
reported no uncovered measured diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The
branch was based on current `origin/main` (`cb9ac1784`) and pushed with
`PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after the local diff-cover pass. The PR was
created via REST and labeled `codecov`; GitHub-hosted CI is the merge gate. No
Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 20:58 PDT: addressed the real Codex review finding on #2130. Pushed
follow-up `3a77e1f6d` (`test(runtime): join tcp coverage server threads
safely`) on `feature/phase3-codecov-batch-684`, changing the TCP coverage tests
so all assertions after starting a server thread are non-fatal until the thread
has been joined. This preserves the same behavior checks while preventing
aborted test cases from leaving joinable threads behind. Focused local
validation passed: `git diff --check`, `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-network-stream -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, and
`./build/test/pulp-test-network-stream "[phase3]"` (92 assertions / 13 cases).
The branch was pushed with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1`; GitHub-hosted checks are
rerunning. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 20:58 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2132,
`test: batch runtime utility and environment coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-685`, head
`55a6242a9bb1d08c5a64ab0d065cd7ac98e713533`. This batch adds 12 focused tests
across `test/test_runtime_utils.cpp` and `test/test_environment.cpp` covering
DynamicLibrary closed lookups, move construction/assignment, failed reopen
state, InterProcessLock contention, Environment publishes without listeners,
multi-listener snapshots, token reset/self-move/move-unsubscribe behavior,
subscriptions added during dispatch, and reset-to-default behavior. Local
validation before PR: `git diff --check`; built `pulp-test-runtime-utils
pulp-test-environment`; ran `./build/test/pulp-test-runtime-utils
"[coverage][phase3]"` (25 assertions / 6 cases) and
`./build/test/pulp-test-environment "[coverage][phase3]"` (34 assertions / 7
cases); ran the 12-test `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=...
tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate, which reported no uncovered measured
diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The branch was pushed with
`PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` only after the local diff-cover pass. The PR was
created via REST and labeled `codecov`; GitHub-hosted CI is the merge gate. No
Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 21:38 PDT: addressed two queue-wide GitHub-hosted CI issues. #2103
had a real macOS UBSan failure in `HotReloader file watcher ignores unsupported
changes`: a pending startup reload could be observed during the unsupported-file
loop. Pushed `7a55d961a` (`test(view): drain hot reload startup events`) after
focused local validation with `git diff --check`, `cmake --build build --target
pulp-test-hot-reload -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)`, and
`./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload "HotReloader file watcher ignores unsupported
changes"` (8 assertions / 1 case). #2132 had a real Windows coverage failure:
the Codecov uploader decoded `codecov.yml` with the Windows default code page
and crashed on UTF-8 punctuation in comments. Pushed `0ecd66bab` (`ci: keep
codecov config ascii for windows uploader`) after confirming `LC_ALL=C rg -n
"[^\x00-\x7F]" codecov.yml` returned no matches and `git diff --check` passed.
The same one-file ASCII fix was then cherry-picked and pushed to the other open
coverage branches #2103, #2123, #2124, #2126, #2129, #2130, and #2134 so they do
not each burn a Windows coverage cycle on the same uploader crash. No
Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 21:46 PDT: opened the next large batched coverage PR as #2135,
`test(canvas): batch attributed text layout coverage edges`, branch
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-688`, head
`7e4d1605da0ed47ca5d5b49dd263cf8f887fa140`. This batch adds 12 focused tests in
`test/test_attributed_string.cpp` covering AttributedString empty-span
concatenation and style setter preservation, TextLayout wrapped-style
preservation, consecutive newlines, forced breaks, span-specific metrics,
GlyphArrangement totals/hit-test thresholds/cross-line index lookup, and
Parallelogram positive/negative shear hit testing. The branch also carries the
ASCII `codecov.yml` fix for the Windows uploader. Local validation before PR:
`git diff --check`; built `pulp-test-attributed-string`; ran
`./build/test/pulp-test-attributed-string "[coverage][phase3]"` (56 assertions /
12 cases); ran the 12-test `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=...
tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` gate, which reported no uncovered measured
diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The PR was created via REST because
GraphQL rate limits were exhausted, then labeled `codecov`; GitHub-hosted CI is
the merge gate. No Namespace/SSH validation was dispatched.

2026-05-16 22:14 PDT: continued the next local-only batch in
`feature/phase3-codecov-batch-687` without opening a PR yet, to avoid adding
another CI job while the current queue drains. The batch currently adds 26
focused format-layer tests across new `test/test_processor_defaults.cpp`, the
new `test/CMakeLists.txt` target, `test/test_validation_harness.cpp`, and
`test/test_plugin_state_io.cpp`, and `test/test_descriptor_validation.cpp`.
Coverage includes PluginDescriptor bus helpers and flags,
PrepareContext/ProcessContext defaults and pass-through, editor/default ViewSize
contracts, lifecycle no-op hooks, ARA default, state-store pointer wiring,
sidechain/MPE/UMP sidecar pointer set/clear behavior, validation harness
auto-prepare/MIDI-once/report-provider edge contracts, plugin-state binary
payload/declared-size/rollback behavior, and descriptor warning/validity
contracts. Local validation passed: `git diff --check`; built
`pulp-test-processor-defaults`, `pulp-test-validation-harness`,
`pulp-test-plugin-state-io`, and `pulp-test-descriptor-validation`; ran direct
focused tests for all four targets; and ran the 26-test
`PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX=... tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh
pulp-test-processor-defaults pulp-test-validation-harness
pulp-test-plugin-state-io pulp-test-descriptor-validation` gate, which reported
no uncovered measured diff lines and OK at/above the 75% floor. The worktree is
clean and local-only at commit `e1bb1c57c`; it has not been pushed or submitted
yet.

2026-05-16 22:22 PDT, updated 22:42 PDT: completed a second local-only held
batch in `feature/phase3-codecov-batch-689` without opening a PR. The batch
adds 18 focused audio/offline-processing tests across new
`test/test_offline_processor_edges.cpp` and its `test/CMakeLists.txt` target,
plus a narrow source hardening in `core/audio/src/offline_processor.cpp` so
ragged `AudioFileData` is rejected before interleaving instead of reading past a
short channel. Coverage includes invalid `offline_process` inputs, ragged and
empty trailing channel rejection, mono/stereo output shape, block metadata and
tail frame counts, input interleaving and output deinterleaving, output buffer
clearing, tail input padding clearing, block-size boundary behavior, and
`apply_gain` empty/multi-channel/zero/negative/ragged-channel behavior. Local
validation passed: `git diff --check`; built
`pulp-test-offline-processor-edges`; ran direct
`./build/test/pulp-test-offline-processor-edges` (59 assertions / 18 cases);
ran `ctest --test-dir build -R 'offline_process|apply_gain'
--output-on-failure`; and ran `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX='offline_process|apply_gain'
tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh pulp-test-offline-processor-edges`, which
reported 100% diff coverage for `core/audio/src/offline_processor.cpp` and OK
at/above the 75% floor. The worktree is clean and local-only at commit
`ba069e562`; it has not been pushed or submitted yet. Together with held #687
this gives 44 locally validated tests ready to combine into a larger future PR
once the active GitHub queue has room.
