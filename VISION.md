# Pulp

## Five Principles

Pulp is built on five principles:

1. **Permissive licensing**
2. **Modular architecture**
3. **Native platform experiences**
4. **GPU-first rendering**
5. **Modern development workflows**

Everything else follows from these.

---

## What Is Pulp?

Pulp is a cross-platform framework for building audio plugins and applications. It targets VST3, Audio Unit, AUv3, CLAP, LV2, AAX, standalone, and the web — on macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and browsers.

It is MIT-licensed. No royalties. No revenue thresholds. No copyleft. Build what you want, ship it however you want.

It is designed for developers who build software the way software is built now — with AI tools, with fast iteration cycles, with design systems that export to code, with plugins that are scriptable and inspectable. Pulp doesn't bolt these capabilities on. They're in the architecture from the start.

---

## Why Pulp Exists

The dominant audio framework was designed in an era before AI-assisted coding, before GPU-accelerated UIs became practical, before Swift/C++ interop matured, before permissive licensing became table stakes for serious open-source infrastructure. Before WebGPU made it possible to run the same GPU code on desktop, mobile, and the web.

The tools haven't kept up with how we work now.

If you've ever tried to iterate on a plugin UI by recompiling C++ for every color change — you know the problem. If you've ever wanted an AI agent to test your plugin's parameters and compare A/B settings — you know the problem. If you've ever wanted to describe "warm analog synth" and see your entire plugin theme transform live — you know the problem.

Pulp is what we'd build if we started today, knowing what we know now.

---

## The Architecture

### Two Pillars: Processing and Presentation

The processing engine knows nothing about the UI. The UI knows nothing about the renderer. Your DSP code doesn't link against a windowing system. Your windowing system doesn't assume a specific graphics backend.

This isn't just clean architecture. It's what makes everything else possible: headless testing, GPU backend swapping, SwiftUI on Apple alongside JS-scripted UIs on Windows, web export via WASM, and AI agents that can reason about your audio code without loading your entire UI framework into context.

### GPU Rendering with a JavaScript Scripting Layer

This is a fundamental departure from how plugin UIs have been built.

Pulp's primary UI path uses native GPU rendering — WebGPU via Dawn, with Skia Graphite for 2D — driven by a JavaScript scripting layer. You write your plugin UI in JS or TypeScript. The renderer is native GPU at 60–120 FPS. There is no browser. No web view. No process explosion. No cache pollution. No CORS policies.

What you get:

- **Hot-reload** — tweak a color, rearrange a layout, restyle a widget — see the result instantly without recompiling C++.
- **One UI, every platform** — the same JS UI renders through Metal on macOS/iOS, D3D12 on Windows, Vulkan on Linux, and WebGPU in browsers.
- **JS engine per platform** — QuickJS for fast cold-start in plugins, with V8 or JavaScriptCore available where throughput matters more.
- **Audio-native widget library** — rotary knobs, linear faders, level meters, toggles, and parameter controls built around the conventions plugin users expect.
- **Real-time visualization pipeline** — lock-free data flow from the audio thread, built-in metering ballistics, FFT/STFT helpers, waveform and spectrum display widgets.
- **GPU shader effects on UI** — apply blur, glow, shadow, color grading, or custom post-processing passes to any layer of the interface.
- **Platform-native where appropriate** — file pickers, alert dialogs, and context menus delegate to the OS rather than re-implementing them in the GPU layer.
- **Multiple windows** — detachable palettes, floating inspectors, custom popovers, and multi-display layouts.
- **Accessibility from the start** — every widget exposes roles, labels, and values to platform screen readers (VoiceOver, Narrator, Orca).
- **Optional WebView embedding** — for cases where you genuinely want browser content (code editors, documentation panels, HTML previews).

The result is the rapid iteration loop of web development — JS/TS, token-based theming, instant feedback — running on a native GPU renderer with none of the overhead of an embedded browser.

### The Design Workflow

Building a plugin UI should feel like modern frontend development, not like writing a graphics engine.

**AI Style Designer** — Describe a look in natural language ("80s Macintosh", "neon cyberpunk", "minimal Dieter Rams") and watch the entire component showcase transform: colors, widget shapes, shadows, typography, everything. This works with Claude Code, Codex, Stitch, or any AI tool that can read your design tokens and write back changes. The framework makes this trivial — your design system is structured data, not compiled C++.

**Design Language System** — Define your visual identity as a token system: 36+ color tokens, widget geometry, knob rendering styles (arc, filled, notched, glossy), button depths (flat, raised, outlined, beveled), toggle shapes (pill, checkbox, rocker), shadows, gradients, typography. Apply one design language across many plugins. Change a token, everything updates.

**Component Inspector** — Click any widget in a running plugin to see its properties, bounds, theme tokens, render performance, accessibility state. Like browser DevTools but for your native GPU-rendered plugin UI. Debug visually, iterate fast.

**Export Everywhere** — Design tokens export to JSON, CSS variables, C++ headers, GPU shader uniforms, and OKLCH color systems. One source of truth, many output formats.

### Swift-Native on Apple, C++ at the Core

The cross-platform core — DSP engine, plugin format adapters, parameter system, state management, MIDI, audio I/O — is C++20. Same code on every platform.

On Apple platforms, Pulp adds a Swift layer:

- **AUv3 in Swift** — the way Apple intended, not a C++ approximation
- **SwiftUI as an alternative UI path** — declarative, native-feeling, for when you want Apple-native rather than cross-platform
- **Direct C++/Swift interop** — zero function-call overhead since Swift 5.9, no Objective-C++ bridge
- **Accelerate/vDSP** — platform-optimized DSP where it matters

The boundary is clean: C++ owns the real-time audio thread (no ARC, no allocation, no exceptions). Swift owns the host interface and UI. The bridge is narrow and well-defined.

### Plugins as CLIs and MCP Servers

Every Pulp plugin compiles to a command-line tool and exposes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This gives AI agents and automation scripts direct access to the plugin's capabilities:

- **Read and write parameters** — inspect the full parameter tree, change values, observe the effect
- **Run audio through the processing chain** — feed WAV files in, get processed audio out, no DAW required
- **Drive MIDI input** — trigger notes, send CCs, test instrument behavior programmatically
- **Screenshot the UI** — capture the rendered interface at any parameter state for visual regression
- **Automate testing workflows** — CI pipelines can load, configure, process, and verify plugin output end-to-end

The CLI stands on its own for batch processing, headless rendering, and CI validation. The MCP server layers on top for AI-driven workflows. One binary serves all three roles — plugin, CLI, and MCP server — so there's nothing extra to build or maintain.

### Web and WASM

The same plugin that runs as a VST3 in your DAW can run in a browser.

WebGPU (via Dawn) means the GPU rendering layer targets Vulkan, Metal, D3D12, and WebGPU backends without code changes. Emscripten compiles the C++ core to WASM. The JS UI layer runs natively in the browser.

Use cases: interactive web demos, browser-based audio tools, embeddable plugin previews, educational tools, prototyping without installing anything.

### WebGPU Compute for Audio

Since Pulp already uses Dawn for rendering, the GPU compute pipeline is available for audio workloads too. Compute shaders open up massively parallel DSP that would be impractical on the CPU alone — thousands of oscillator partials for additive synthesis, GPU-side FFTs for spectral processing, waveguide mesh networks for physical modeling, or neural network inference for learned audio effects.

This is forward-looking work, not a launch feature. But the plumbing is already in place: Dawn abstracts across Metal, Vulkan, and D3D12, so a compute kernel written once deploys everywhere the renderer does.

### Modular, Not Monolithic

Pulp is organized as independent subsystems:

| Subsystem | Responsibility |
|-----------|---------------|
| **pulp-runtime** | Lock-free structures, SIMD helpers, logging. Uses `std::` where it can. |
| **pulp-events** | Event loop (constructible, not singleton), timers, async dispatch |
| **pulp-audio** | Audio device I/O — CoreAudio, WASAPI, ALSA, Oboe |
| **pulp-midi** | MIDI I/O, MIDI 2.0 UMP, MPE, MIDI-CI |
| **pulp-signal** | DSP — FFT, convolution, filters, oversampling, SIMD, GPU compute |
| **pulp-state** | Typed parameters, reactive bindings, versioned state, undo/redo |
| **pulp-format** | Format adapters — VST3, AU, AUv3, CLAP, LV2, AAX, Standalone, CLI, MCP |
| **pulp-render** | GPU rendering engine — WebGPU/Dawn, Skia Graphite, JS scripting layer |
| **pulp-view** | Widgets, layout, themes, design tokens, accessibility, audio visualization |
| **pulp-inspect** | Component inspector, render stats, live design editing |
| **pulp-platform** | Platform detection, native API bridging, Swift interop |
| **pulp-build** | CMake tooling — `pulp_add_plugin()`, `pulp_add_app()`, SPM, Emscripten |
| **pulp-test** | Testing, plugin validation, audio golden-files, visual regression |
| **pulp-ship** | Packaging, signing, notarization, auto-updates |
| **pulp-ci** | GitHub Actions, secrets management, release automation |
| **pulp-claude** | Claude Code plugin — scaffold, build, test, sign, ship from conversation |

You can use subsystems independently. `pulp-signal` doesn't require `pulp-view`. `pulp-audio` doesn't require `pulp-format`. The dependency graph is a tree, not a tangle.

### Reusable Components

Pulp ships with composed features that go beyond individual widgets — things you'd otherwise rebuild for every project:

| Component | What It Is |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Musical Typing** | Computer keyboard as MIDI input + on-screen piano keyboard. Standard for standalone instrument apps. |
| **Waveform Editor** | Audio waveform display with zoom, selection, and scrubbing. For samplers, editors, recorders. |
| **Diagnostic Reporter** | One-click diagnostic collection (system info, plugin status, crash logs, DAW logs) with privacy-first anonymization and GitHub issue upload. For end-user support. |
| **Audio Device Selector** | Audio/MIDI device picker with sample rate and buffer size configuration. Standard for standalone apps. |
| **Preset Browser** | Load, save, organize, and share presets. Categories, search, favorites. |

Add them to a project:

```bash
pulp add component musical-typing
pulp add component waveform-editor
pulp add component diagnostics
```

Components are styled by your design tokens — they inherit your design language automatically. They're also fully customizable: fork one into your project if you need to modify behavior beyond what configuration allows.

As you build features that are worth reusing, you can extract them as components and share them across your projects or with the community.

---

## The Tooling

### The `pulp` CLI

The developer CLI is the foundation of all Pulp tooling. It works standalone — no AI agent required.

```bash
pulp create "My Synth" --formats vst3,au,clap
pulp build --target vst3
pulp test
pulp ship --sign --notarize
pulp inspect                  # launch component inspector
pulp design                   # launch design tool
pulp add component musical-typing
pulp skill create "midi-routing"  # extract a reusable skill from recent work
pulp audit ~/Code/some-library    # check license, clean-room risk, arch fit
pulp status
```

The CLI is also an MCP server (`pulp mcp serve`), so any AI agent — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini — can use it as a tool. The Claude Code plugin wraps the CLI with conversational workflows, but the CLI is the source of truth.

### Claude Code Plugin

Pulp ships with a Claude Code plugin that covers the full development lifecycle:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/pulp:create` | Scaffold a new plugin or app project with interactive configuration |
| `/pulp:build` | Build with intelligent CMake regeneration detection |
| `/pulp:test` | Unit tests, format validation, golden-file comparison, visual regression |
| `/pulp:ci` | GitHub Actions — trigger builds, check status, sync secrets |
| `/pulp:ship` | Package, sign, notarize, create GitHub Release, update download page |
| `/pulp:port` | Audit and port between macOS, Windows, Linux, and web |
| `/pulp:setup-gpu` | Add GPU-accelerated rendering to an existing project |
| `/pulp:setup-swift` | Add the Swift UI layer for Apple platforms |
| `/pulp:setup-ios` | Add an iOS/iPadOS target |
| `/pulp:setup-updates` | Add auto-update support with EdDSA signing |
| `/pulp:inspect` | Launch the component inspector on a running plugin |
| `/pulp:design` | AI-driven design session — describe a look, export tokens |
| `/pulp:status` | Project dashboard — config, build state, features, VMs |
| `/pulp:website` | Generate a GitHub Pages download page |

| `/pulp:skill` | Extract a reusable skill from something you built, or create one from scratch |
| `/pulp:audit` | Audit a library, project, or code pattern for license compatibility, clean-room risk, and architecture fit |

This isn't a bolt-on. The framework, the build system, the project templates, and the Claude plugin are designed together. The plugin knows the framework's structure. The framework is structured so the plugin can reason about it.

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows ship with every Pulp project:

- Multi-platform build matrix (macOS ARM64, Windows x64, Linux x64)
- Plugin format validation tests (CLAP dlopen, VST3 load tests; auval and pluginval available for local use)
- macOS code signing and notarization via `notarytool`
- Windows Authenticode and Azure Trusted Signing
- EdDSA-signed artifacts for Sparkle/WinSparkle auto-updates
- Draft GitHub Releases with per-platform installers
- Automatic download page updates on `gh-pages`
- WASM build and deploy for web demos

### Build System

CMake 3.24+ for the cross-platform core. Swift Package Manager for Apple Swift targets. Emscripten for WASM/web builds. All work together.

```cmake
pulp_add_plugin(MySynth
    FORMATS VST3 AU AUv3 CLAP Standalone Web
    PLUGIN_NAME "My Synth"
    BUNDLE_ID "com.mycompany.mysynth"
    VERSION "1.0.0"
)
```

## The Design Decisions

### Why MIT?

The audio development ecosystem needs permissive infrastructure. AGPL forces source disclosure or commercial licensing. Dual-license models create business risk and adoption friction. MIT means: use it, ship it, don't worry about it.

### Why C++20?

C++20 gives us the language features that make a modern plugin framework practical: `std::span` for non-owning buffer views, `std::jthread` for RAII-managed background threads, `<format>` for logging, and designated initializers for readable plugin descriptors. We lean on the standard library rather than reinventing it.

### Why GPU Rendering with JS, Not Web Views?

Embedding a browser engine in a plugin is tempting — you get hot-reload, familiar tooling, and a massive ecosystem. But every DAW developer who's opened Activity Monitor after loading a few web-view plugins knows the cost. Each instance brings its own renderer process, its own caches written to disk, its own tens of megabytes of idle memory. The C++ ↔ JavaScript bridge requires serialization across process boundaries. Real-time audio visualization has to cross that bridge on every frame. And you inherit the browser's security model — content security policies, cross-origin restrictions — designed for untrusted web content, not for a knob that lives inside your DAW.

Pulp takes a different path: native GPU rendering (WebGPU via Dawn, Skia Graphite for 2D) with an embedded JS engine (QuickJS) running in-process. No browser. No IPC. No subprocess tree. Your UI code is JavaScript, so you get hot-reload and rapid iteration. But the rendering is native GPU at full frame rate, the JS engine shares the plugin's address space, and audio data flows to visualization widgets through lock-free queues — no serialization, no bridge latency.

### Why Plugins as CLIs and MCP Servers?

Because audio plugin development should work like modern software development. Your plugin should be testable from a script. Your CI should be able to load it, set parameters, process audio, and verify output — without launching a DAW. An AI agent should be able to interact with your plugin the same way it interacts with any other tool.

The CLI gives you batch processing, headless testing, and automation. The MCP server gives AI agents native access. Same binary, multiple interfaces.

### Why Composable Themes and Design Tokens?

The dominant framework's styling system is a single class that inherits from every widget's style interface. Add a widget, modify the base class. Upgrade the framework, fix your theme.

Pulp uses a design token system. Colors, typography, spacing, widget geometry, and rendering styles are structured data — JSON that any tool can read and write. AI tools can update your design by writing tokens. Your design language applies across plugins. Changes propagate instantly via hot-reload. Themes are data, not inheritance hierarchies.

### Why Reactive Bindings?

Plugin parameters should update the UI when they change — not 30 times per second regardless. Pulp's parameter bindings are reactive: UI views subscribe to parameter changes and update only when values actually change. No timer ticks. No wasted repaints.

### Why Headless-First?

`pulp-format` links against `pulp-audio`, `pulp-midi`, and `pulp-state` — not against `pulp-view` or `pulp-render`. You can build, test, and validate a plugin's audio processing without any UI code in the dependency tree. This makes CI faster, tests cleaner, CLIs lighter, and AI agents more effective.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Audio | MIDI | Plugin Formats | UI | GPU | Swift |
|----------|-------|------|----------------|-----|-----|-------|
| macOS (ARM64) | CoreAudio | CoreMIDI | VST3, AU, AUv3, CLAP, AAX, Standalone | JS + GPU | Metal | Yes |
| Windows (x64) | WASAPI | Win32 MIDI | VST3, CLAP, AAX, Standalone | JS + GPU | D3D12 | — |
| Linux (x64) | ALSA, JACK | ALSA MIDI | VST3, CLAP, LV2, Standalone | JS + GPU | Vulkan | — |
| iOS (ARM64) | AVAudioSession | CoreMIDI | AUv3, Standalone | JS + GPU | Metal | Yes |
| Web (WASM) | Web Audio | Web MIDI | — | JS + WebGPU | WebGPU | — |

ASIO on Windows supported when developers provide the Steinberg SDK independently. AAX requires the Avid SDK from Avid.

## What Pulp Is Not

Pulp is not a fork of any existing framework. It is a clean-room implementation informed by experience with existing tools, built independently from specification.

Pulp is not a wrapper. It implements audio I/O, MIDI, plugin formats, rendering, and UI from the ground up — using permissively-licensed format SDKs (VST3 under MIT, AudioUnit under Apache 2.0, CLAP under MIT).

Pulp is not finished, and it is not yet competitive with mature frameworks on all fronts. It is an alpha-stage project that works well enough to ship real plugins but still has rough edges, missing features, and architecture that is evolving.

---

## Standing on Shoulders

Pulp comes from two years of building audio apps and plugins, maintaining forks and patches across multiple projects, and eventually deciding it was time for something built ground-up for the way we actually work — AI-assisted, fast iteration, permissive licensing, no patching.

### Projects We Respect

**Oli Larkin** deserves particular recognition. His work on [iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) and the upcoming [iPlug3](https://github.com/iPlug3) set the vision for what a modern, permissively-licensed audio framework looks like. iPlug3 arrived at many of the same architectural conclusions as Pulp — Dawn, Skia Graphite, QuickJS — and did so from deeper experience. We studied iPlug2/3 for architecture and patterns (never code), and we're honest that iPlug3's vision helped validate and shape our own direction.

**[Visage](https://github.com/VitalAudio/visage)** by Matt Tytel is a GPU-accelerated UI framework that informed our thinking about Metal view embedding, multi-touch on iOS, and keyboard handling in DAW hosts. We reference Visage for patterns and have documented what we studied and how we reimplemented independently.

Oli Larkin and Matt Tytel are industry veterans building tools with decades of experience behind them. They have good reasons for how they run their projects, including who they accept contributions from. Out of respect for that, Pulp exists as its own thing rather than attempting to contribute to projects where AI-assisted development isn't welcome. That's not a criticism — it's an acknowledgement that different developers have different standards, and the right response is to build something that fits your own workflow rather than push your way into someone else's.

**JUCE** is the dominant framework. Two years of building plugins with JUCE — maintaining [JUCE-Plugin-Starter](https://github.com/niclamusic/JUCE-Plugin-Starter), the juce-dev tooling, and various forks — taught us what works and what we'd change. Pulp follows strict clean-room rules: we never reference JUCE source during implementation. But the experience of using JUCE is what made Pulp's requirements clear.

### Standards and Specs

**[CLAP](https://cleveraudio.org)** is the plugin format Pulp leans on most heavily. The community's openness and willingness to evolve the spec is a big part of why Pulp exists.

**[WebCLAP](https://github.com/WebCLAP)** defined how CLAP plugins run in WebAssembly. **[signalsmith-clap-cpp](https://github.com/geraintluff/signalsmith-clap-cpp)** by Geraint Luff showed how the WASI SDK build pipeline and CLAP webview extension work in practice.

**[WAMv2](https://www.webaudiomodules.com)** defined web audio plugin standards. **[CHOC](https://github.com/Tracktion/choc)** by Tracktion provides battle-tested utilities we use extensively. **[Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn)** and **[Skia](https://skia.org)** are the GPU rendering foundation.

### Why This Exists

Pulp started from a specific situation: 30+ years in tech, two years building audio apps, tired of maintaining patches and forks across multiple projects, and ready for tools designed for AI-assisted development from the start. It is built primarily for one end customer — the author — with the hope that it's useful to others who work the same way.

---

## The Road Ahead

Every phase ships a validation example that proves the framework works. These examples stay in the repo and grow across phases.

| Phase | What Ships | Validation Example |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Repository, build system, CI pipeline | — |
| 2–3 | Core runtime, event system, CMake tooling, scaffolding | **PulpGain** — trivial gain plugin (standalone) |
| 4 | Audio I/O, MIDI I/O, standalone apps | **PulpTone** — oscillator synth with MIDI and musical typing keyboard |
| 5 | VST3, AU, CLAP adapters, parameter system, state | **PulpEffect** — filter plugin with automation and state save/load |
| 6 | GPU rendering, JS scripting, design tokens, inspector | **PulpDrums** — generative drum sequencer with GPU UI and audio visualization |
| 7 | CLI + MCP server, full Claude Code plugin | **PulpSynth** — macro oscillator synth with full GPU UI, presets, and AI-addressable MCP interface |
| 8 | Signing, notarization, packaging, auto-updates | All examples signed and distributed |
| 9 | Web/WASM target, documentation, DSP library | **PulpSampler** — YouTube audio sampler with waveform editor and musical typing (native only; web version TBD) |
| 10 | Hardening, DAW validation, public release | All examples validated across DAWs |

### The Five Examples

**PulpGain** — The simplest possible plugin. A gain knob. Validates that the build system works, a plugin can be scaffolded, and audio passes through. Every framework needs a "hello world."

**PulpTone** — A simple oscillator synth (sine, saw, square) with MIDI input. The standalone app includes a musical typing keyboard — use your computer keyboard as a piano (like GarageBand/Logic's Musical Typing) with an on-screen piano keyboard for mouse/touch input. This becomes a standard feature available to all Pulp standalone instrument apps. Validates audio I/O, MIDI I/O, and the standalone app wrapper.

**PulpEffect** — A filter effect (lowpass/highpass/bandpass) with cutoff, resonance, and mix parameters. Loads in a DAW as VST3, AU, and CLAP. Parameters automate. State saves and restores. Validates the format adapters and parameter system end-to-end.

**PulpDrums** — A generative drum sequencer MIDI effect inspired by topographic rhythm maps. Four voices (kick, snare, hi-hat, clap), density and chaos controls, pattern morphing. Outputs MIDI — drop it before a drum instrument in your DAW. The first example with a full GPU-rendered UI: knobs, a pattern grid, real-time metering, design tokens. Validates the rendering engine, JS scripting, hot-reload, MIDI output, audio visualization, and the component inspector.

**PulpSynth** — A macro oscillator synthesizer with multiple oscillator models, modulation, and a full preset system. GPU UI with the design token system applied. Exposes CLI and MCP server interfaces so AI agents can adjust parameters, compare presets, and process audio programmatically. Validates the complete plugin-as-tool workflow.

**PulpSampler** — A sample player and YouTube audio sampler with drag-and-drop loading, a waveform editor, and the musical typing keyboard. The native version downloads audio from YouTube via bundled tools (yt-dlp, ffmpeg) — drop a URL, get a playable sample. The most complex example — validates file I/O, external tool integration, complex UI interactions, and the full development workflow. A simplified web version (file loading only, no YouTube downloading) may follow later.
