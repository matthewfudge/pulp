# CI Skill

Validate branches and ship code safely. This skill handles all CI workflows for Pulp across local machines and VMs.

## Prerequisites Check

Before running any CI command, verify the required tooling exists:

```bash
# Required
test -f tools/local-ci/local_ci.py || echo "ERROR: local CI not found — is this a recent checkout?"
command -v gh >/dev/null || echo "ERROR: gh CLI not installed (brew install gh)"

# Preferred (shared machine-global local CI config)
test -f "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Pulp/local-ci/config.json" || echo "WARNING: no shared local CI config — copy tools/local-ci/config.example.json there"

# Fallback (worktree-local legacy config)
test -f tools/local-ci/config.json || echo "WARNING: no worktree fallback config.json"
```

If `local_ci.py` doesn't exist, the user likely has an older checkout. Tell them to pull latest main.

## Language Correction

**IMPORTANT**: When a user says "push to main", "merge to main", or "land this", ALWAYS correct them:

> "I won't push directly to main — that bypasses review. Instead, I'll create a PR, run CI on it, and merge it if everything passes. This keeps main safe."

Then proceed with the `ship` workflow below.

## Commands

### `ship [branch]` — The main workflow

Creates a PR, runs CI, and merges on green. This is the default when someone says "ship this" or "push to main".

1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Push the branch to origin with `-u`
3. Create a PR to main via `gh pr create`
4. Run local CI: `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run <branch>`
5. If ALL targets pass → `gh pr merge <PR#> --squash --delete-branch`
6. If ANY target fails → report failures, leave PR open
7. Notify when done (terminal bell)

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch]
```

### `run [branch]` — Just validate, no PR

Run local CI on the current branch without creating a PR or merging.

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch]
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --smoke
```

If you pass a branch name explicitly, `run [branch]` resolves that branch tip to an exact SHA before queueing. It must not silently reuse the launching checkout's `HEAD`.

Queueing now performs a submission preflight before the job is recorded:
- prints the queued worktree root, current cwd, config path/source, and per-target host intent
- rejects accidental wrong-root launches by default
- rejects obviously unreachable SSH targets by default when they have no fallback path

Override flags exist for deliberate exceptions:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --allow-root-mismatch
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --allow-unreachable-targets
```

For SSH targets, `run` uploads the exact queued SHA as a git bundle before validation, so Ubuntu and Windows do not need that branch tip to be visible on the host ahead of time.
Use `--smoke` for a fast clean install/export preflight when you want early signal before paying for the full test matrix. Smoke runs are explicitly labeled as `validation=smoke`.
If you queue a newer SHA for the same branch, targets, and validation mode, older pending work is superseded automatically.

Useful queue controls:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --targets mac
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --smoke --targets windows
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py enqueue [branch] --priority low
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py bump <job-id> high
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target windows
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py evidence [branch]
```

### `check <PR#|URL|latest>` — Validate an existing PR

Run CI on an existing PR by number, GitHub URL, or "latest".

1. If `latest` → use `gh pr list --limit 1 --json number` to get the most recent PR
2. If URL → extract PR number from the URL
3. Fetch the PR's head branch: `gh pr view <number> --json headRefName`
4. Checkout that branch locally
5. Run local CI: `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run <branch>` or `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py check <PR#> --smoke` for a fast preflight
6. Post results as a PR comment via `gh pr comment`

### `list` — Show open PRs

Show open PRs with summaries so the user can pick one to check or merge.

```bash
gh pr list --json number,title,author,headRefName,createdAt,labels --template '{{range .}}#{{.number}} {{.title}} ({{.headRefName}}) by {{.author.login}} {{timeago .createdAt}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

### `status` — Queue, live target state, and VM status

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py status
```

While a job is still running, `status` can show live target state for the active job, for example `mac=pass, ubuntu=pass, windows=running`. Quiet phases should now surface heartbeat and idle/liveness hints instead of looking dead by default.

### `logs [job]` — Tail a saved target log

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target windows
```

Use this when a target looks slow or stuck. The logs come from the machine-global CI state directory, so you can inspect a running job without manual SSH.

When you need to reproduce an intermittent failure locally before spending another full CI run, use:

```bash
tools/scripts/repeat-until-fail.sh 100 -- ctest --test-dir build -R "<test name>" --output-on-failure
```

### `evidence [branch]` — Show last-good exact-SHA target evidence

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py evidence
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py evidence feature/my-branch --limit 3
```

Use this when a branch has been validated through narrow reruns and you need to know what is already proven without rerunning targets that already passed on the same SHA.

## Active CI Incident Loop

Do not treat a running CI job as something to check later. When a local CI job is active, one agent should own the monitoring loop and one agent or process should work the likely fix path locally as soon as a failure becomes actionable.

Required behavior while a job is active:
- Poll `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py status` proactively.
- Tail `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target <name>` as soon as a target fails or looks stuck.
- Send user updates without waiting to be asked when a target changes state, a failure appears, or a rerun is queued.
- If one target has already failed, stop treating the rest of that job as the only source of truth. Start local repro or code inspection immediately when the failure is actionable.
- Once a failure is actionable, parallel work is required unless it would contend with the same host or invalidate the active run. Keep one CI owner watching the hosts and one local loop reproducing or patching the likely issue.
- Do not sit idle waiting for unrelated targets to finish if the first failing target already tells you what to investigate.
- Never rerun a target that already passed on the exact same SHA unless the prior result is untrustworthy or the environment changed.
- If only part of the matrix is stale, rerun only that subset of targets.
- Once the failure surface is isolated, prefer the minimum sufficient proof instead of a symmetric rerun. If macOS and Ubuntu already passed on the current head and only Windows changed or failed, rerun Windows only.
- A direct exact-SHA validation on one target is acceptable merge evidence for that target. Do not invalidate earlier same-SHA passes on other targets just because they came from a different run.
- Use `validation=smoke` before full CI when the risk is install/export/build structure rather than runtime test behavior.
- Treat `all targets on one SHA` as a goal, not a reason to blindly rerun already-green same-SHA targets.
- On persistent local/self-hosted targets, prefer prepared same-SHA reruns for narrow follow-up validation and make `prepared=clean` vs `prepared=reused` visible in status/logs.
- Prefer the shared machine-global CI config (`state_dir()/config.json`; on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Pulp/local-ci/config.json`) so every worktree sees the same host map by default.
- Treat worktree-local `tools/local-ci/config.json` as a fallback or temporary override only. Hostnames and `repo_path` values can drift between worktrees.
- Pay attention to the submission preflight. If it says the cwd git root and queued worktree root differ, stop and fix that unless the mismatch is intentional.
- If preflight reports shared-state vs worktree-local config drift for the selected targets, treat that as a real warning, not cosmetic noise.
- If a dead runner left behind a stale Windows validator, let the queue reclaim that specific remote validator before starting fresh work; treat that cleanup as part of the truthful narrow-rerun path, not as ad hoc manual SSH.

Minimum incident response once a failure is visible:
1. Capture the failing job id, target, SHA, validation mode, and first failing test/build step.
2. Decide whether the failure is infrastructure, environment drift, or a likely code/test issue.
3. If actionable, begin the fix or repro loop immediately instead of waiting for the whole matrix to finish.
4. Queue the narrowest truthful rerun needed after the fix.
5. Close the loop with a short status update that says what failed, what is being tried now, and what still remains.

### `cloud run [branch]` — Trigger GitHub Actions

Trigger cloud CI only when cloud CI is actually needed, for example
workflow-semantics changes, release validation, or a neutral-host confirmation
that local CI cannot provide. Prefer the built-in `pulp ci-local cloud ...`
surface instead of raw `gh workflow run`:

```bash
pulp ci-local cloud workflows
pulp ci-local cloud defaults
pulp ci-local cloud run build <branch>
pulp ci-local cloud run validate <branch>
pulp ci-local cloud run docs-check <branch> --provider namespace
```

### `cloud status` — Check GitHub Actions

```bash
pulp ci-local cloud status
pulp ci-local cloud status latest --refresh
```

`cloud defaults` is the companion visibility command when you need to see the
current effective workflow/provider defaults and where Namespace selectors are
coming from before dispatching a run.

Use raw `gh workflow run` / `gh run view` only as a fallback when debugging the
GitHub side of the operator surface itself.

## Configuration

Config is machine-global by default at `state_dir()/config.json` (on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Pulp/local-ci/config.json`).
`tools/local-ci/config.json` is the gitignored fallback, and `PULP_LOCAL_CI_CONFIG` overrides both.
Template at `tools/local-ci/config.example.json`.

Key fields:
- `targets.mac.enabled` — run local Mac validation (default: true)
- `targets.ubuntu` — SSH target for Linux validation
- `targets.windows` — SSH target for Windows validation
- `targets.<name>.host` — primary SSH host alias
- `targets.<name>.fallback_host` — optional secondary SSH host alias if the primary is unreachable
- `targets.<name>.utm_fallback` — optional UTM VM to boot only if SSH hosts are unreachable
- `targets.windows.cmake_generator` / `targets.windows.cmake_platform` — optional Windows CMake generator settings; if `cmake_platform` is omitted the runner infers `ARM64` vs `x64` from the remote host
- `targets.windows.cmake_generator_instance` — optional explicit Visual Studio instance path; if omitted the runner prefers a full VS install over `BuildTools` when both exist
- `defaults.priority` — default queue priority for `run` and `enqueue`
- `defaults.ship_priority` — default queue priority for `ship`
- `defaults.check_priority` — default queue priority for `check`
- `github_actions.repository` — optional `owner/repo` override for cloud commands
- `github_actions.defaults.workflow` — default workflow key for `cloud run`
- `github_actions.defaults.provider` — default cloud runner provider
- `github_actions.defaults.wait_poll_secs` — cloud wait polling interval
- `github_actions.defaults.match_timeout_secs` — dispatch-to-run match timeout
