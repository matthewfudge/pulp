# AU v2 Skill

Use this when you are:

- Touching `core/format/src/au_v2_adapter.cpp` / `.hpp` or the AU v2 instrument adapter
- Changing how Pulp packages AU v2 plug-ins in CMake (`tools/cmake/PulpUtils.cmake`, `tools/cmake/PulpInfoPlist.au.in`)
- Debugging "plug-in loads but never receives MIDI" reports against an AU host
- Picking or changing a plug-in's AU component type (4-char `type` in the Info.plist)
- Wiring new AU v2 features that require splitting base-class inheritance (adding `AUMIDIBase`, `MIDIOutput`, etc.)

Scope is AU v2 only. AU v3 (AUAudioUnit-based app extensions) has different rules and lives behind the `ios` skill + `core/format/src/au_adapter.mm`.

## AU v2 Component Types — Pick the Right 4cc

Hosts route MIDI based on the bundle's `type` field. Getting this wrong produces a silent-failure: the plug-in scans, loads, renders audio, and never sees a MIDI event.

| `type` | Constant                    | Audio I/O | MIDI I/O | When to use                                |
|--------|-----------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| `aufx` | `kAudioUnitType_Effect`       | in + out  | none     | Audio-only effect (compressor, EQ, reverb) |
| `aumf` | `kAudioUnitType_MusicEffect`  | in + out  | in       | Effect that wants inbound MIDI (arpeggiator on audio, MIDI-triggered gate, vocoder w/ MIDI carrier) |
| `aumi` | `kAudioUnitType_MIDIProcessor`| none      | in + out | MIDI-only processor (transpose, arp, chord, note filter) |
| `aumu` | `kAudioUnitType_MusicDevice`  | out only  | in       | Instrument / synth                         |

**Load-bearing rule:** Logic, MainStage, GarageBand, and other AU hosts will **never** call `MIDIEvent` / `HandleMIDIEvent` on an `aufx`-typed plug-in. If a plug-in's `Processor::descriptor()` sets `accepts_midi = true` and the bundle is still packaged as `aufx`, MIDI silently disappears — the adapter looks correct, the Info.plist looks correct to a casual reader, but no MIDI arrives.

Pulp's `pulp_add_plugin()` automates the choice from two inputs:

1. `CATEGORY` — `Effect` | `Instrument` | `MidiEffect`
2. `ACCEPTS_MIDI` — bool option that mirrors `PluginDescriptor::accepts_midi`

The resulting mapping (`_pulp_add_au` / `_pulp_add_auv3` in `tools/cmake/PulpUtils.cmake`):

```
(Instrument,  *)     -> aumu
(MidiEffect,  *)     -> aumi
(Effect,      true)  -> aumf    <-- easy to forget
(Effect,      false) -> aufx
```

When you add a new example or change an existing one's descriptor to declare `accepts_midi = true`, you **must** also add `ACCEPTS_MIDI` to its `pulp_add_plugin()` call. There is no runtime fallback — the two surfaces are independent and the CMake flag is what ends up in the Info.plist.

## MIDI Input Wiring

The AU v2 effect adapter inherits from `AUMIDIEffectBase` (`AUEffectBase` + `AUMIDIBase`) so the SDK's `MIDIEvent` / `SysEx` entry points exist. Inbound MIDI flows:

```
host -> AUMIDIBase::MIDIEvent(status, data1, data2, frame)
     -> AUMIDIBase::HandleMIDIEvent(strippedStatus, channel, data1, data2, frame)
     -> PulpAUEffect::HandleMIDIEvent(...)   <-- our override
        - lock midi_mutex_
        - push MidiEvent into pending_midi_
```

At the top of `ProcessBufferLists()` we drain under the same lock:

```
lock midi_mutex_
midi_in = std::move(pending_midi_)
pending_midi_ = {}
unlock
midi_in.sort()    // sample-accurate ordering
processor_->process(..., midi_in, midi_out, ctx)
```

The instrument adapter (`core/format/src/au_v2_instrument.cpp`) uses the same `pending_midi_` + `midi_mutex_` pattern against the `MusicDeviceBase` base class. If you're adding a third MIDI-aware AU, mirror that shape exactly — resist the urge to share a mixin until there's a third entry to fold.

### Decode helper: `decode_midi_event()`

`AUMIDIBase::HandleMIDIEvent` delivers the status byte already split into a top nibble and a separate channel. The free function `pulp::format::au::decode_midi_event(status, channel, data1, data2)` in `core/format/include/pulp/format/au_v2_adapter.hpp` recombines them into a `choc::midi::ShortMessage` with the correct on-the-wire status byte and returns a `MidiEvent` with `sample_offset == 0`. Tests cover CC, pitch bend, note-on, program change, and system messages (status 0xF0+ keep their literal byte — channel nibble is ignored).

### SysEx

`AUMIDIBase::HandleSysEx(data, length)` does not carry a per-event sample offset at this SDK layer. We enqueue the payload with `sample_offset == 0` so it is delivered at the leading edge of the current `ProcessBufferLists()` block.

## Current Gaps

- **MIDI output from AU v2 effects** is not wired yet (tracked as #626). `Processor::process()` can write to `midi_out`, but `PulpAUEffect` has no render-notify callback / `MIDIOutput` mixin that emits those events back to the host. Effects that declare `produces_midi = true` work in CLAP / VST3 but stay silent on AU v2. `descriptor.produces_midi` is *not* wired to a CMake flag yet — the AU type selection is driven entirely by `accepts_midi`.

- **AU v3 parity** for MIDI on effects is not re-audited in this pass. If you touch `core/format/src/au_adapter.mm`, confirm the AUv3 `componentType` logic in `_pulp_add_auv3` still matches the fix in `_pulp_add_au`.

## Gotchas

### DAW component cache — clear it after a `type` change

Logic, MainStage, GarageBand, Studio One, Live, and every other AU host maintain a **host-side cache** of AU descriptors, keyed on subtype + manufacturer. When you change a plug-in from `aufx` to `aumf` (or vice versa) *without* also changing the subtype, hosts will keep the cached-old-type descriptor and behave as if the fix never shipped — you'll install a fresh `.component` and the host will still treat it as `aufx`. Symptoms: rebuilt plug-in appears in the correct MIDI-effect slot of the host UI only after a restart, or never appears at all.

Mitigation when you test a type change locally:

```bash
# Kill the AU registration cache so the next host launch re-inspects the bundle.
killall -9 AudioComponentRegistrar 2>/dev/null || true

# Logic / MainStage / GarageBand — clear the AU cache next to the host DBs.
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/AudioUnitCache
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.audiounits.cache

# auval rescan catches the new type without needing a host restart.
auval -a | grep <subtype>
auval -v <type> <subtype> <manufacturer>
```

Document this step in any issue or PR that flips a shipped plug-in's component type.

### `auval` tests on persistent runners — kill the cache before every run

Self-hosted CI runners (and local dev iteration where the same plug-in is
rebuilt repeatedly) hit the same `AudioComponentRegistrar` cache that
hosts use. Even with the `.auvaltest.component` rename trick (copy to a
suffixed path to avoid the canonical `.component` collision), the cache is
keyed by **bundle ID**, so a stale entry from the previously-installed
canonical bundle survives. `auval` then reports:

```
ERROR: Cannot get Component's Name strings
ERROR: Error from retrieving Component Version: -50
* * FAIL
FATAL ERROR: didn't find the component
```

even though the freshly-copied bundle is well-formed (`nm` shows the AU
factory symbol, `plutil -p Info.plist` is valid, `codesign -dv` succeeds).
On a fresh machine the test passes; on a persistent runner it
intermittently fails.

The fix is one line in the `auval` ctest command — kill the registrar
between install and validation:

```cmake
add_test(NAME auval-MyPlugin
    COMMAND bash -c "d=\"$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/MyPlugin.auvaltest.component\"; \\
                     rm -rf \"$d\"; \\
                     cp -R \"${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/AU/MyPlugin.component\" \"$d\" && { \\
                         killall -KILL AudioComponentRegistrar 2>/dev/null || true; \\
                         sleep 1; \\
                         auval -v aufx MyFx Pulp 2>&1 | tee /dev/stderr | grep -q 'PASS'; \\
                     }; \\
                     rc=\$?; rm -rf \"$d\"; exit \$rc")
```

`|| true` prevents `set -e` exit when no registrar is running; `sleep 1`
gives macOS time to relaunch the daemon before `auval` queries it. The
PulpEffect/PulpGain/PulpTone/PulpPluck examples all use this pattern.
ChainerSynth doesn't need it because its `aumu Chnr` codes are first-time
unique on the runner, but any new `aufx`/`aumu`/`aumf` plug-in sharing a
manufacturer+subtype pattern with an existing test should add the cache
kill.

Surface symptom matches the host-cache one above; the difference is
*you can't rely on `.auvaltest.component` alone* to defeat it.

### `AUEffectBase` vs `AUMIDIEffectBase`

If you see `HandleMIDIEvent` that never fires: check the base class. `AUEffectBase` alone has no `AUMIDIBase` mixin — the SDK only wires `MIDIEvent` dispatch when the class multiply inherits `AUMIDIBase` (directly or via `AUMIDIEffectBase` / `MusicDeviceBase`). When you add a new AU v2 adapter, inheriting from `AUMIDIEffectBase` is cheap even for audio-only effects — the class does nothing extra until the host actually delivers MIDI, and it future-proofs the adapter against a later `accepts_midi` flip.

### `GetProperty` / `GetPropertyInfo` chain

With `AUMIDIEffectBase`, fall-through calls should go to `AUMIDIEffectBase::GetProperty(...)`, not `AUEffectBase::GetProperty(...)`. `AUMIDIEffectBase::GetProperty` tries `AUEffectBase::GetProperty` first and then falls back to `AUMIDIBase::DelegateGetProperty`. Calling `AUEffectBase` directly skips the MIDI-mapping property delegation — hosts that query `kAudioUnitProperty_AllParameterMIDIMappings` would silently return no mapping.

### CXX_STANDARD on tests that include AU adapter headers

`core/format/include/pulp/format/au_v2_adapter.hpp` pulls `AudioUnitSDK/AUMIDIEffectBase.h`, which on AudioUnitSDK 1.4 uses `std::expected` (C++23). Apple clang only exposes `std::expected` when the *consuming TU* compiles at `-std=c++23`. Any test executable that includes the adapter header must set `CXX_STANDARD 23` explicitly — linking `pulp::format` is not enough because CMake treats `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20` at the root as authoritative per target. See `core/format/CMakeLists.txt` for the equivalent pin.

### `pending_midi_` mutex is a slow-path correctness tool, not a fast path

The `std::mutex` guarding `pending_midi_` is contended only on the MIDI-delivery thread (where the host calls `HandleMIDIEvent`) and the audio thread (once per block, to drain). It is NOT the right primitive for per-event audio-thread publication. Do not extend this pattern to any new path that runs multiple times per block — switch to `choc::fifo::SingleReaderSingleWriterFIFO` if you need lock-free MIDI delivery inside a single block.

### `AUMIDIBase` splits the status byte for EVERY message

`AUMIDIBase::MIDIEvent` (AudioUnitSDK 1.4 `AUMIDIBase.h`) unconditionally splits the wire-format status byte before dispatching:

```
strippedStatus = inStatus & 0xF0   // -> HandleMIDIEvent's inStatus
channel        = inStatus & 0x0F   // -> HandleMIDIEvent's inChannel
```

The split happens for system messages (0xF0-0xFF) the same way as for channel-voice (0x80-0xEF). For 0xF8 (timing clock) the SDK calls `HandleMIDIEvent(inStatus=0xF0, inChannel=0x08, ...)`. The decoder MUST reassemble `(inStatus & 0xF0) | (inChannel & 0x0F)` regardless of the top nibble — special-casing system messages and returning `inStatus` unchanged turns every clock / start / stop / song-position into 0xF0 (sysex start). Codex review on PR #638 caught the buggy special case; the unit test in `test/test_au_v2_effect.cpp` now feeds the post-split shape (status=0xF0, channel=0x08) so the regression cannot reappear without flipping a test red.

### `AUSDK_RTSAFE` position with `override` — Xcode 16.4 incompat

`AUSDK_RTSAFE` expands to `[[clang::nonblocking]]`. AudioUnitSDK's own base-class declarations use `... AUSDK_RTSAFE;` (no `override`), but placing the attribute between a function declarator and the `override` virt-specifier in a derived class compiles under older Xcode and fails on Xcode 16.4 / Clang 17+ with:

```
error: expected ';' at end of declaration list
```

The attribute is a static-analysis hint only — dropping it from derived-class `override` declarations has no runtime effect. `PulpAUInstrument::HandleNoteOn/Off` (the reference pattern for AU v2) doesn't carry `AUSDK_RTSAFE` either. When writing a new AU v2 override that matches an `AUSDK_RTSAFE` base declaration, omit the attribute. Caught on CI's Coverage-macOS leg in PR #638 after the AU v2 effect MIDI fix landed without it.

### Editor `dealloc` ordering — never call `bridge->close()` explicitly

`PulpAUEditorOwnership` (in `core/format/src/au_v2_cocoa_view.mm`) declares its members as `unique_ptr<ViewBridge> bridge` then `unique_ptr<PluginViewHost> host`. C++ destroys members in REVERSE declaration order, so when `delete _ownership` runs in `PulpAUEditorOwner::dealloc`:

1. `~PluginViewHost` runs first. The host calls `root_.set_plugin_view_host(nullptr)` to clear the View → host back-pointer. The View it references is still alive (still owned by `bridge->view_`), so the call is safe.
2. `~ViewBridge` runs second. Its destructor calls `close()` → `Processor::on_view_closed(*view_raw_)` fires → `view_.reset()` destroys the View. The back-pointer was already cleared in step 1, so the View's own teardown can't reach a dead host.

Calling `_ownership->bridge->close()` HERE explicitly (BEFORE `delete _ownership`) reverses that order: the View dies first, then `~PluginViewHost` dereferences a dangling `root_` reference and crashes the AU v2 editor close path. Codex P1 review on PR #653 caught this — the fix is to remove the explicit close, NOT to add it. Same rule applies to any future Cocoa-View ownership wrapper that mixes a `ViewBridge` and a `PluginViewHost` in the same C++ scope.

### Editor GPU host is auto-selected — don't hardcode `use_gpu`

`au_v2_cocoa_view.mm` no longer sets `Options::use_gpu` by hand; it calls
`pulp::format::decide_gpu_host(*bridge)` so a Skia/Dawn/scripted editor gets the
GPU `PluginViewHost` automatically (hardcoding `use_gpu=false` was the bug that
made it fall back to AutoUi/CPU). It also wires `host->set_resize_callback(...)`
because AU v2 has **no host size callback** — the DAW resizes the returned
NSView directly, so native frame changes are forwarded to `bridge->resize()`
through that seam. Full contract: the `view-bridge` skill's "GPU view host
auto-selection" section. (GPU-plugin-view-host work, 2026-05.)

### AU v2 MUST advertise its Cocoa view, or the host shows its generic UI

Selecting the GPU host (above) is necessary but NOT sufficient. The host only
loads the Pulp editor if the AU advertises `kAudioUnitProperty_CocoaUI`. For a
long time NO Pulp AU v2 did — `fill_cocoa_view_info()` existed but was never
wired into `GetProperty`, so Logic/auval saw `Cocoa Views Available: 0` and fell
back to a generic param view (the symptom: a plain "Level" slider instead of the
real editor). Both `PulpAUEffect` and `PulpAUInstrument` now serve
`kAudioUnitProperty_CocoaUI` in `GetProperty`/`GetPropertyInfo`. Watch-outs:

- The adapters compile into the shared `pulp-format` lib **without** `PULP_AU_GUI`,
  while the Cocoa view module (`au_v2_cocoa_view.mm`) is added per-`*_AU` target
  **with** it. So an `#ifdef PULP_AU_GUI` in the adapter is always off. The view
  is reached via a runtime hook `g_cocoa_view_info_filler` (hidden visibility,
  defined in `au_v2_adapter.cpp`) that the view module's static-init registers.
  Query it ungated; null → delegate to base (no view).
- The **instrument** (`PulpAUInstrument`, `MusicDeviceBase`) must ALSO serve
  `kPulpEditorContextProperty` — the Cocoa view factory reads it to reach the
  Processor + StateStore. It originally overrode no `GetProperty` at all.
- **`CFBundleCopyBundleURL` PAC-crashes** (`__CFCheckCFInfoPACSignature`,
  PAC_EXCEPTION/SIGKILL) inside pointer-auth-hardened sandboxed hosts (Logic's
  `AUHostingServiceXPC`, auval) the instant the view is queried — a hardware trap
  a `@try` cannot catch. Use `-[NSBundle bundleURL]` instead. This was the actual
  reason the editor never loaded even in code paths that tried.
- The factory ObjC class name MUST be **per-plugin-unique** (`PULP_AU_COCOA_VIEW_CLASS`,
  injected per `*_AU` target from MFR+CODE 4ccs). ObjC class names are
  process-global; two Pulp AUs in one host would collide on a fixed name.
- Validate with `auval -v` → expect `Cocoa Views Available: 1`. Covered by
  `test/test_au_v2_cocoa_ui.mm`.

### `auval` automation must disable editor creation

`auval` can instantiate AU editor surfaces during validation, which is
not acceptable in CI, headless tests, or local agent runs. CTest/CLI
validator paths must carry
`PULP_DISABLE_PLUGIN_EDITOR=1 PULP_HEADLESS=1 PULP_TEST_MODE=1`; the AU
Cocoa view factory returns `nil` under those guards. Keep this
environment on every `auval-*` test even if the validator command itself
looks audio-only.
