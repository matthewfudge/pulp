# Design for Pulp — Figma plugin

Exports Figma designs to a Pulp-native JSON schema that the Pulp importer (`pulp import-design --from figma-plugin`) consumes. Plan: [`planning/2026-05-28-pulp-figma-plugin-strategy.md`](../../planning/2026-05-28-pulp-figma-plugin-strategy.md) (in the `pulp-planning` submodule).

**Status: working exporter with Pulp library recognition.** The plugin walks the
selected frame(s), extracts geometry / layout / typography / style / tokens /
assets, recognizes Pulp library components (Knob / Fader / Meter / XYPad / Waveform / Spectrum) and emits them
as semantic audio-widget nodes, and exports a `*.pulp.json` (or `*.pulp.zip`
when assets are present) that `pulp import-design --from figma-plugin` consumes.
The exporter lives in `src/extract.ts`, `src/serialize.ts`, and
`src/library-registry.ts`, and builds to `dist/code.js`.

For full setup — both the Figma Community install path and the local-dev path,
plus publishing — see [`docs/guides/figma-plugin.md`](../../docs/guides/figma-plugin.md).

## Local development install

```bash
cd tools/figma-plugin
npm install
npm run gen-types     # regenerates src/types.generated.ts from schema/figma-plugin-export-v1.json
npm run build         # produces dist/code.js + dist/ui.html + dist/headless.js
npm run typecheck     # all three entries (code + ui + headless)
```

`npm run build` produces three artifacts: `dist/code.js` (UI plugin sandbox),
`dist/ui.html` (iframe with inlined JS), and `dist/headless.js` (the
**headless** extractor, see below).

Then in Figma desktop (**first time only**):

1. Open any file (a **Figma Pro** workspace — local-dev plugins don't load in
   Community/free files).
2. **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest…**
3. Pick `tools/figma-plugin/manifest.json` from this checkout.
4. **Plugins → Development → Design for Pulp** to launch.

Select a frame, then **Export to Pulp** to download the `*.pulp.json` (or
`*.pulp.zip` when the design has assets). Feed either straight to the importer —
`pulp import-design --from figma-plugin <file>` reads a `.pulp.zip` directly.

**Rebuild, don't re-import.** After the first manifest import, code changes are
picked up by **`npm run build` + re-running the plugin** — Figma re-reads
`dist/` fresh on every run. You only **re-import the manifest** if
`manifest.json` itself changes. Use `npm run build:watch` to rebuild on save.

## Headless extraction (`dist/headless.js`)

`dist/headless.js` is a minified IIFE of the same `extractScene` +
`serializeExport` core that powers the UI plugin, **without the UI iframe
or message loop**. It's designed to be inlined into a Figma MCP `use_figma`
call and run inside Figma's actual Plugin API sandbox by an agent.

**Why this exists alongside the REST port:** Pulp also ships
[`tools/import-design/figma_rest_export.py`](../import-design/figma_rest_export.py),
which is the production headless path (no Figma Desktop needed; just a
Figma PAT). The headless bundle here is a *conformance oracle*: because
it runs the same Plugin API code path the user clicks through, its
output is the gold standard the REST port is benchmarked against. If
the two ever diverge, the conformance test (`P3-alt`) flags it.

### Bundle size discipline

`use_figma` caps its `code` parameter at 50 000 chars. The build asserts
`dist/headless.js` stays under 49 KB so the agent's small prelude
(`const TARGET_NODE_ID = "..."`) plus trailing
`return await globalThis.__pulp_headless_result;` always fits. If the
extractor grows past that, `npm run build` fails loudly — the fix is to
split shared code into a tinier core (see P2 in
`planning/figma-import-coordination-log.md`).

### Driving from an agent

```bash
node scripts/run-headless.mjs 26:3 > /tmp/payload.js
```

The script prints a self-contained JS payload to stdout: the
`TARGET_NODE_ID` prelude + the bundle + the trailing await/return. The
agent passes the file contents verbatim as the `code` parameter to
`mcp__figma__use_figma`:

```js
mcp__figma__use_figma({
  fileKey: "vxW6btjzQtc4t9ITLNjev0",
  description: "headless export of kitchen-sink frame",
  code: <contents of /tmp/payload.js>,
})
```

The tool result is a plain object:

```ts
{
  envelope: <full v1 envelope>,
  envelope_json: <pretty-printed string>,
  assets: [{ content_hash, mime, bytes: number[] }, ...],
  node_count: 59,
  diagnostic_count: 0,
  asset_count: 6,
  truncated: false,
  suggested_name: "PluginEditor",
  target_node_id: "26:3"
}
```

Pack `envelope_json` as `scene.pulp.json` + each `assets[i].bytes` as
`assets/<content_hash>.<ext>` into a zip; the result is a valid
`*.pulp.zip` for `pulp import-design --from figma-plugin`.

Pass `--selection` to `run-headless.mjs` instead of a node id to fall
back to whatever frame the user has selected in Figma (matches the UI
plugin's behaviour). Selection mode is mostly useful for interactive
debugging.

## Versioning relationships

Three independently versioned things:

- **Plugin version** (`package.json` + `manifest.json`'s `_pluginVersion` once Figma assigns an id) — bumped on plugin code changes.
- **Library version** (`library-manifest.json` `library_version`) — bumped when the Pulp Figma Library file gains/changes widgets.
- **Export format version** (`schema/figma-plugin-export-v1.json`) — bumped on incompatible JSON-shape changes. Currently pinned to `2026.05-figma-plugin-v1`.

The plugin embeds its `library_manifest` snapshot into every export so the Pulp importer knows what version of the library a given JSON came from.

---

## Privacy posture

- Manifest declares `"networkAccess": { "allowedDomains": ["none"] }` — the plugin can't make any network call.
- No telemetry, no analytics, no usage tracking.
- All processing happens on the user's machine.

---

## Pipeline (all landed)

- **Extract** (`src/extract.ts`) — walk the selection into an `ExtractedFigmaNode`
  tree: geometry, auto-layout, typography, fills/strokes/radius/opacity, images,
  and recursive children.
- **Recognize** (`src/library-registry.ts`) — map Pulp library component
  instances to audio-widget kinds (Knob / Fader / Meter / XYPad / Waveform / Spectrum), authoritatively by
  component key and as a fallback by name prefix.
- **Serialize** (`src/serialize.ts`) — emit the v1 JSON envelope declared in
  `schema/figma-plugin-export-v1.json`, with provenance, the library-manifest
  snapshot, tokens, an asset manifest, and diagnostics.
- **Import** — the Pulp CLI lane: `parse_figma_plugin_json` in
  `core/view/src/design_import.cpp`, reached via
  `pulp import-design --from figma-plugin`.
