// ARA (Audio Random Access) — minimal document controller stub.
// Full ARA 2.0 support is a large undertaking; this provides the interface
// structure so plugins can declare ARA capability without a full implementation.
//
// ARA allows DAWs to provide the plugin with direct access to audio content,
// enabling features like spectral editing, chord detection, and time-stretching
// without real-time playback.
