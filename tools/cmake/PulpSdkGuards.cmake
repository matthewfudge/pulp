# PulpSdkGuards.cmake — defensive guards for downstream find_package(Pulp).
#
# Extracted from PulpConfig.cmake.in in the 2026-05 B3 refactor. The
# guard block below preserves its original header text on purpose so
# the fixture `test/cmake/test_debug_sdk_guard.cmake` can locate it
# by its regex.

# Debug-SDK perf-killer guard.
#
# A Pulp SDK that was itself BUILT with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ships
# debug-mode Skia, debug-mode audio framework, and debug-mode JS
# engine. Consuming it from a downstream plugin produces real-time
# audio code so slow that buffer underruns happen on every reasonable
# host — a UX failure mode that's hard to attribute to "the SDK
# install is wrong" because the link succeeds and the plugin appears
# to work, just very poorly.
#
# The CMakeLists.txt that produced this SDK install writes the
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE it was configured with to
# `${PULP_SDK_DIR}/sdk_build_type.txt`. If we can read that file and
# it contains "Debug", refuse the find_package — with an escape hatch
# (`PULP_ALLOW_DEBUG_SDK=ON`) for the rare developer who *does* want
# a Debug SDK.
#
# Empty marker file (older SDK installs that predate the marker) and
# multi-config generators (which install per-config without recording
# a single canonical build-type) fall through silently — we cannot
# tell, so we don't warn.
