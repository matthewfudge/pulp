# Phase 3 Codecov Queue Pause Ledger

Last updated: 2026-05-01 EDT

This local ledger records the open `codecov` PR validation runs paused to free Namespace capacity for higher-priority work, plus the small-batch resume queue. Branches, PRs, commits, labels, and tracker comments stay intact; queued GitHub Actions validation attempts are cancellable and replaceable.

## Queue Policy

- Reopen Codecov validation in small batches; do not dump the full paused queue back into Namespace at once.
- While a batch is in flight, continue local-only tranche preparation, review, and failure triage.
- Merge `UNSTABLE` PRs only when GitHub branch protection shows all required checks are green and the PR can merge normally.
- For merge eligibility after a pause, refresh PR branches with `gh pr update-branch <pr>` so GitHub creates fresh `pull_request` check suites.
- Use `shipyard cloud run build <branch> --provider namespace --require-sha <sha> --no-wait` only as a Namespace smoke or targeted diagnostic; successful `workflow_dispatch` checks do not replace stale failed or cancelled `pull_request` contexts for branch protection.
- If one lane is slow or stuck, prefer `shipyard cloud retarget`/`shipyard cloud add-lane` so existing useful runs are preserved instead of cancelled wholesale.
- Branch protection currently requires the lower-case `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` contexts. The visible Namespace child jobs may appear as
  `Linux (x64) [namespace]`, `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`, and
  `Windows (x64) [namespace]`; wait for the lower-case reusable-workflow
  wrappers to settle before declaring a PR mergeable.

## Snapshot Summary

- Open `codecov` PRs in snapshot: 73
- Queued/in-progress Codecov-branch workflow runs selected for cancellation: 193
- Selected workflows: Build and Test, Coverage, Sanitizer Tests

## Cancellation Result

- Cancellation pass completed on 2026-04-30 EDT.
- Cancellation requests submitted successfully for all 193 recorded runs.
- A few runs completed while cancellation was in flight; sticky queued
  runs for #1133 and #1134 required a second cancellation request.
- Final verification after GitHub settled: 0 queued or in-progress
  workflow runs remained for the open `codecov` PR branches in this
  snapshot.
- Expected side effect: cancelled validation attempts may leave PRs
  `BLOCKED` or `UNSTABLE` until the queue is reopened and fresh
  validation runs are dispatched.

## Resume Batches

### 2026-05-01 Batch 1: Build Gate Refill

Namespace capacity check showed no queued or in-progress GitHub workflow
runs for `danielraffel/pulp`, so the first refill batch replaced only the
cancelled `Build and Test` gates for recent Codecov PRs. Existing passing
Codecov/version/docs/license results were left intact.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `bf87273e0534` | Build and Test | `25202620106` | in progress |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `2d2c119b4c8d` | Build and Test | `25202620128` | in progress |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `cb6fb9c4e9c3` | Build and Test | `25202620088` | in progress |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `2b2ccde36e63` | Build and Test | `25202620280` | in progress |

Next refill rule: when this batch drops below four active Codecov build
runs, dispatch the next merge-ready paused PRs by pinned SHA and update
this table before adding more local-only tranche PRs.

Follow-up correction: these `workflow_dispatch` runs all passed, but they
did not satisfy branch protection because stale failed or cancelled
`pull_request` check runs with the same required context names remained on
the PR head commits. The branches were then refreshed against `main` with
`gh pr update-branch` to create merge-eligible PR-event check suites:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `f48a49e62ec3` | `25203370720` | `25203370713` | pending |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `bccfec4797d5` | `25203371862` | `25203371864` | pending |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `45dbdda453a3` | `25203373031` | `25203372990` | pending |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `14098f98d57e` | `25203374251` | `25203374250` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 2: Build Gate Refill

The first batch assigned cleanly on Namespace with no GitHub queued-run
backlog, so a second four-PR batch was queued behind it. This keeps the
active window warm without re-dispatching the full paused set.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `46854e04fcf2` | Build and Test | `25202718222` | queued |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `5149c107a3ac` | Build and Test | `25202718230` | queued |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `6fea2fa4686a` | Build and Test | `25202718329` | queued |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `a6237254b05d` | Build and Test | `25202718395` | queued |

Note: `shipyard cloud run build` printed older saved run IDs for #1136
and #1137, but `gh run list` confirmed the fresh workflow_dispatch run
IDs above.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 3: Build Gate Refill

A third build-only batch was queued after #1136-#1139. #1131 was not
queued because its `Diff coverage required` check is red and needs
coverage-gate triage before a build-only re-run can make it mergeable.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `2695097458c4` | Build and Test | `25202770455` | queued |
| #1133 | `feature/audio-channel-set-coverage-640-next` | `df227394cd7e` | Build and Test | `25202770462` | queued |
| #1134 | `codex/coverage-phase3-tranche-20260430095455` | `1dbd12f64ba0` | Build and Test | `25202770509` | queued |
| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `89242ca0bfa5` | Build and Test | `25202770726` | queued |

Held for triage: #1131 `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next`
has passing `codecov/patch` but failing `Diff coverage required`, so it
likely needs a coverage workflow re-run or a patch rather than build-only
refill.

Follow-up correction: because build-only dispatches do not clear stale
PR-event contexts, the queued or running build-only dispatches for
#1132-#1139 were cancelled after the #1140-#1143 branch-refresh batch
started. Cancelled workflow_dispatch run IDs: `25202718222`,
`25202718230`, `25202718329`, `25202718395`, `25202770455`,
`25202770462`, `25202770509`, and `25202770726`.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 4: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After confirming the build-only dispatches were not merge-eligible
evidence, the next refill batch used `gh pr update-branch` so GitHub
created fresh required `pull_request` checks.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `bc32ea5904b6` | `25203513486` | `25203513496` | pending |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `476677d7b926` | `25203494171` | `25203494182` | pending |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `cc7fcaf98be8` | `25203494454` | `25203494423` | pending |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `72fa08f3553a` | `25203493849` | `25203493834` | pending |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `df3f376fa716` | `25203493795` | `25203493796` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 5: PR-Event Branch Refresh

Namespace still had the earlier PR-event batch queued but not failing, so
the next low-risk stale build-matrix PRs were refreshed in a small batch.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1129 | `feature/midi-sysex-accumulator-coverage-645-next` | `a5ae96aa067c` | `25203575118` | `25203575127` | pending |
| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `8b403641dfd4` | `25203575435` | `25203575450` | pending |
| #1133 | `feature/audio-channel-set-coverage-640-next` | `a82513bedc13` | `25203575337` | `25203575346` | pending |
| #1134 | `codex/coverage-phase3-tranche-20260430095455` | `8c91ac2d0315` | `25203575338` | `25203575315` | pending |

Follow-up refresh after `main` advanced through #1141 and #1131:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `539bbb76c41a` | `25204395492` | `25204395482` | pending; fresh PR-event checks queued with sanitizer run `25204395501` and IWYU run `25204395484` |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 6: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After #1139 merged and GitHub Actions pressure dropped to 18 active
runs, the next four patched/stale Codecov PRs were refreshed with
`gh pr update-branch` so branch protection gets fresh `pull_request`
contexts. Pressure after dispatch rose to 39 active runs, with 24 queued
and 13 in progress, so hold further refill until this batch drains.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Sanitizer Run | IWYU Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1051 | `feature/signal-poly-math-coverage-645` | `0675a09ecabd` | `25207650057` | `25207650060` | `25207650064` | `25207650080` | queued/in progress |

## Merge Waves While Queue Is In Flight

These PRs were already green/mergeable when the paused queue was
reopened, so they were squash-merged without consuming additional
Namespace capacity. #1099 became conflicted after the preceding view
coverage merges and is held for a branch refresh.

## Conflict And Failure Triage

| PR | Branch | New Head | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1099 | `feature/view-layout-widgets-coverage-493` | `66decf5958e8` | Merged as `a18291ee6642` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers passed; advisory lanes were still pending. |
| #1084 | `feature/runtime-text-diff-coverage-641` | `cb63e51416ed` | Merged as `66c74123430a` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers passed; advisory macOS sanitizer lanes were still pending. |
| #1089 | `feature/view-file-browser-coverage-493` | `86cbe4ca12e9` | Conflict resolved and pushed. The first refreshed run failed `Enforce version & skill sync`; a metadata-only empty commit added `Version-Bump: sdk=skip reason="test-only file browser coverage; no SDK release surface change"`. Local worker validated skill-sync, version-bump with required-bump enforcement, and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`. Fresh PR checks are queued. |
| #1131 | `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next` | `f5af90f4f5af` | Pushed coverage-harness fix for Windows `.exe` object discovery in `scripts/run_coverage.sh`; `bash -n`, `test_run_coverage.py`, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check` passed. Local CMake validation was not rerun after the harness patch because the laptop filesystem had only about 150-211 MiB free; the earlier excerpt binary validation was already green and the platform-sensitive coverage fix now needs CI/Namespace. |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `e4ea28dfc2e0` | Pushed a test isolation fix after macOS Namespace exposed a parallel CTest temp-dir collision in `test_cli_projects_registry.cpp`. Focused local `pulp-test-cli-projects-registry "add_project falls back to directory basename when no name hint"` passed; skill-sync/version-bump reports and `git diff --check` passed. Merged as `ea731cbf365c` after required wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff coverage passed; advisory macOS sanitizer lanes were still pending. |
| #1079 | `feature/volume-detector-coverage-642` | `5efc687e53a0` | Conflict resolved after #1045 landed overlapping service-discovery coverage. Kept the non-duplicated lifecycle coverage from #1079, dropped the now-duplicated backend registration failure test, validated `pulp-test-network-service-discovery`, focused `[issue-642]`, broad `NSD|MountedVolumeListChangeDetector|LockingAsyncUpdater` CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then force-with-lease pushed. Fresh PR checks are queued. |

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 02:12 EDT

- Merge-now set: none.
- Watch first: #1123, #1099, #1132, #1142, #1143. These are mergeable at
  the Git level, have no real failing checks, and are waiting on the
  underlying Namespace/build or coverage legs before the lower-case
  required aliases can go green.
- #1075 was the only fresh actionable gate failure in this sweep
  (`Enforce version & skill sync` after the coverage workflow patch);
  it was fixed with metadata-only head `4469868e669b`.
- Older PRs with red lower-case `linux`/`macos`/`windows` contexts mostly
  reflect the deliberate queue-cancellation pause and need future
  PR-event branch refreshes in small batches, not immediate code patches.
- Queue pressure at the audit: roughly 72 active Codecov-like workflow
  runs across 25 branches, so do not refill Namespace until the current
  batch drains.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 02:55 EDT

- Open `codecov` PRs: 44.
- Merge-now set: none. All open Codecov PRs currently report
  `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED`.
- GitHub Actions pressure: 60 queued workflow runs and 4 in progress for
  `danielraffel/pulp`, so do not add another PR-event refresh batch yet.
- Watch first: #1143, #1142, #1139, #1137, #1140. #1143 has Linux,
  Windows, diff coverage, Codecov patch, and advisory coverage/sanitizer
  lanes green, but its required `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]` build wrapper
  is still queued. #1142 is similarly waiting on macOS build and macOS
  coverage. #1139/#1137 are still waiting on macOS Namespace lanes, with
  #1137 also waiting on the Linux build wrapper.
- Local-only progress continues while the queue drains. Workers were
  assigned to refresh `local/phase3-merge-cobertura-extra-643`,
  `local/phase3-lcov-cobertura-extra-643`, and
  `local/phase3-run-python-coverage-extra-643` against current
  `origin/main`; no push, PR, or Namespace dispatch until capacity returns.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 03:17 EDT

- Open `codecov` PRs: 43 after #1120 merged.
- Merge-now set: none. A fresh merge-candidate query returned no
  `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` open Codecov PRs.
- GitHub Actions pressure remained high at 58 queued and 5 in progress,
  so no additional PR-event refresh batch was added.
- #1143 remained blocked only on the queued `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`
  build job. A dry-run `shipyard cloud retarget --pr 1143 --target macOS
  --provider github-hosted --workflow build` showed a clean single-job
  retarget plan, but `--apply` could not cancel the queued job because
  the current `gh` token lacks `actions:write`. Leave the existing
  Namespace lane intact unless a human cancels it manually.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 03:33 EDT

- #1138 merged as `44cff0532848`; tracker comments posted to #641 and
  #493.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 40 after #1138 merged.
- Merge-now set: none. A fresh merge-candidate query returned no
  `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` open Codecov PRs.
- GitHub Actions pressure after the small refill batch: 50 active
  Codecov-like workflow runs, with 45 queued and 5 in progress.
- Watch first: #1143 and #1142 are still blocked on old queued macOS
  Namespace jobs. Keep those existing useful runs rather than pushing
  branch-refresh noise that would invalidate already-green lanes.
- Refill batch added because pressure had dropped below the earlier
  58-72 queued range:

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 03:38 EDT

- #1082 merged as `b0903cd8ed4b` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and the relevant platform build
  lanes were green. Advisory macOS sanitizer/coverage jobs were still
  queued at merge time.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #646.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 39 immediately after the merge; fresh
  merge-candidate poll returned none.
- Subsequent queue poll: 57 active Codecov-like workflow runs, with 51
  queued and 6 in progress. Do not add another Namespace/PR-event refill
  batch yet; continue local-only prep and merge monitoring.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 03:56 EDT

- #1135 merged as `44e67d52cbfc` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff coverage were green.
  Advisory macOS sanitizer jobs were still queued at merge time.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #645.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 38 immediately after the merge.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 04:08 EDT

- #1139 merged as `d701d4ae8d45` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Namespace build lanes, and Codecov patch were
  green. Pending macOS coverage and sanitizer jobs were advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #642.
- Queue pressure immediately before the merge was 18 active GitHub
  workflow runs, with 17 queued and 1 in progress, so capacity is low
  enough for another small refill batch rather than a full queue dump.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 04:30 EDT

- #1134 merged as `a01ca7410faa` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, coverage lanes,
  and sanitizer lanes were green.
- #1119 merged as `0bf8f64aeb8b` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. Pending macOS
  coverage was advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 for both merges and to #645 for #1134.

### Merge And Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:12 EDT

- #1137 merged as `ea731cbf365c` from `UNSTABLE` after required
  `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff
  coverage were green. Pending macOS ASan/UBSan jobs were advisory.
  Tracker comments were posted to #641 and #640.
- #1184 opened from the previously local memory-message-channel tranche
  as `feature/memory-message-channel-coverage-641` at
  `065ef90edbd3`. It was labeled `codecov`; PR-event checks are queued
  and explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209211899` was started with
  `shipyard cloud run build feature/memory-message-channel-coverage-641
  --provider namespace --require-sha HEAD --no-wait`.
- #1185 opened from the previously local binding tranche as
  `feature/state-binding-coverage-641` at `c1e5bd595244`. It was
  rebased onto `origin/main`, revalidated locally with
  `pulp-test-binding`, focused `Binding` CTest, skill-sync report,
  version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled `codecov`.
  Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209337122` is queued/running.
- The first #1184 `shipyard pr` attempt used the unskipped local target
  config and stopped before PR creation when SSH Windows timed out. The
  retry used the documented Namespace-first pattern:
  `shipyard pr --skip-target mac --skip-target ubuntu --skip-target
  windows`, followed by the explicit Namespace dispatch above.

### Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:21 EDT

- #1186 opened from the text-layout worker tranche as
  `feature/canvas-text-layout-coverage-641` at `d4d40aa77928`. It was
  rechecked locally with `pulp-test-text-shaper`, focused text-shaper
  CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`,
  then labeled `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch
  `25209419094` is queued/running.
- #1187 opened from the SVG worker tranche as
  `feature/canvas-svg-coverage-641` at `7e4e8c5fabdd`. It was rechecked
  locally with `pulp-test-svg`, exact `^SvgImage ` CTest, skill-sync
  report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled
  `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209443645` is
  queued/running.
- AssetManager worker output is held local-only because #1125 is already
  open on `feature/view-asset-manager-coverage-493-next` for the same
  surface.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:23 EDT

- #1143 merged as `d36fddc2cd9f` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, and platform
  build/coverage lanes were green. Pending macOS UBSan was advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #646.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:27 EDT

- #1075 merged as `c34f11f7138c` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. The red Windows
  coverage job was advisory artifact-upload plumbing: coverage suite,
  Cobertura existence check, and Codecov upload succeeded; only the
  Cobertura artifact upload step failed.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #643.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:33 EDT

- #1133 merged as `e1a22a1ffd93` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, and coverage/build
  lanes were green. Pending macOS ASan/UBSan jobs were advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #640.

## Real Diff-Gap Patch Queue

These PRs were inspected after the pause. The failures are not just stale
branch-protection checks; the repo diff-coverage gate reported concrete
uncovered changed lines. Assigned items have workers patching their own
branches in separate worktrees.

Local disk note: after completed Codecov worktrees pushed their fixes, their
generated `build/` directories plus stale generated build outputs from
older Codecov worktrees were removed. Source worktrees and branches were
left intact. Free space recovered from about `192 MiB` to about `4.7 GiB`.
