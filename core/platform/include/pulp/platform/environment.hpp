/// @file environment.hpp
/// Unified environment API: display, safe-area, keyboard, orientation,
/// color scheme, foreground/background, memory pressure.
///
/// Each platform populates the fields it can observe; unsupported fields
/// retain their default. Listeners receive a snapshot of the new state
/// + a bitmask of which fields changed since the last notification.
///
/// Thread model: Environment is meant to be read from any thread (the
/// snapshot accessor returns a value copy). Listeners are invoked on the
/// thread that delivered the platform event — typically the main UI
/// thread — but no global locking is held during dispatch, so listener
/// bodies that touch shared state must apply their own synchronization.
///
/// This header defines the contract and an in-process notifier. Platform
/// adapters live under `core/platform/platform/{android,ios,mac,win,linux}/`
/// and call Environment::dispatcher().publish(...) when their respective
/// OS callbacks fire (Android `Configuration.onConfigurationChanged`,
/// iOS `UITraitCollection`, macOS `NSApplicationDidChangeScreenParameters`,
/// Windows `WM_DPICHANGED`/`WM_SETTINGCHANGE`, Linux XSettings + Wayland
/// fractional scale).
