// Reference-free import-fidelity self-checks. Each invariant is a small pure
// function registered in one table; codegen captures the geometry it already
// computes and calls run_fidelity_checks() at each branch. Adding an invariant
// = one function + one registry line here — design_codegen.cpp does not grow.
//
// Every check reads only normalized DesignIR geometry + the emitted dimensions,
// never a source quirk, so all sources (figma, figma-plugin, pencil, stitch,
// v0, claude) are validated by the same checks.

/// a visible fill — OR already carry an explicit unsupported diagnostic. A bare
/// vector that codegen would drop to an empty `createRow` frame (no asset, no
/// children, no fill — its stroke/path/border art silently vanishes) is

/// This is a TREE pass, not a per-element registry check, for two reasons the
/// single-node FidelityContext cannot serve: (1) the dropped node hits codegen's
/// generic-frame fall-through, which has no run_fidelity_checks call site; and
/// (2) the false-positive gate "a vector child consumed into a parent widget is
/// not dropped" needs subtree context. The walk mirrors generate_native_node's
/// recursion exactly — it descends EXCEPT into the terminal image/widget/text
/// branches — so a knob's consumed stroke-ellipse is never falsely flagged.
///
/// `diagnostics` is `DesignIR::diagnostics`: a node already carrying a
/// render-affecting import diagnostic (matched by stable_anchor_id or structural
/// path) is suppressed so the silent-drop finding never double-reports a drop
/// the importer already surfaced. `node_id_of` maps a node to the bridge id
/// codegen emitted for it (codegen passes a lookup over its real id map; tests
