//! Usage banner + known-command inventory — shared source of truth.
//!
//! # Why a dedicated module
//!
//! Three call sites need the same command list:
//!
//! - [`crate::cmd::help::run`] — the explicit `pulp-rs help` subcommand.
//! - `main::real_main` — the bare-invocation case (`pulp-rs` with no
//!   args), which in the C++ CLI prints the usage banner and exits 0.
//! - `main::suggest_closest` — the fuzzy-match "Did you mean…?" helper
//!   that runs when `clap` rejects an unknown subcommand.
//!
//! Duplicating the command table between those sites is exactly how
//! drift enters: someone adds a Rust-only subcommand, the suggester
//! forgets about it, the help banner forgets about it, and a month
//! later the post-implementation audit (see `UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`) finds
//! the drift. One inventory, one writer — no drift.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! [`Entry`] mirrors the C++ dispatch tables in `pulp_cli.cpp`:
//!
//! - `commands[]` — native Rust-ported (or to-be-ported) subcommands.
//! - `script_commands[]` — Python-script delegates (Rust does not
//!   re-implement them; the banner just lists them so users can see
//!   they're available on the C++ binary).
//! - `binary_commands[]` — built-binary delegates (same treatment).
//! - Package-manager pseudo-commands (`add`, `audit`) — parked in a
//!   second block to match the C++ banner's shape.
//!
//! Entries are ordered to match the C++ banner byte-for-byte. The
//! `help_parity_test` integration test pins that.
//!
//! # Parity posture
//!
//! The Rust port's banner intentionally mirrors the C++ banner even
//! when the subcommand isn't ported yet. The user still invokes
//! `pulp`/`pulp-rs` expecting the same surface; a "ported or not"
//! distinction belongs in `UPSTREAM_SYNC.md`, not in user-visible
//! output.
