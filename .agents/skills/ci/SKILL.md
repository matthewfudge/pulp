# CI Skill

Validate branches and ship code safely. This skill handles all CI workflows for Pulp across local machines and VMs.

> **If a PR's required `macos` check has been queued >30 min** or the
> repo's PRs are all in `mergeable_state=blocked` with no movement,
> jump to **"Self-hosted runner ops"** near the end of this file.
> One-shot recovery is `shipyard rescue <PR>` (Shipyard v0.53.0+).
> Continuous prevention is `shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers`
> (v0.54.0+). Keep Shipyard itself current with `shipyard update`
> (v0.55.0+; Pulp currently pins v0.56.2+). All three replace the
> legacy `planning/scripts/runner-watchdog.sh --fix` workflow, which is
> now an anti-pattern (cancels queued runs but registers `failure` on
> required checks).

## Pre-flight: plugin ↔ CLI skew check

Before shelling out to `pulp` (or `shipyard pr`, which ultimately
invokes `pulp`), source the shared skew-check helper so a user on an
outdated CLI sees a one-line hint rather than running into obscure
flag-missing errors mid-ship:

```bash
source "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tools/scripts/cli_version_check.sh"
pulp_cli_version_check
```

This is advisory only — the helper never blocks. See the `upgrade`
skill for the full banner contract and override knobs
(`PULP_SKEW_CHECK_DISABLE`, `PULP_SKEW_CHECK_CACHE`). Release-discovery
Slice 6 (#551).

## Shipping a PR: route through `shipyard pr`

When the user says any of: **"push to main"**, **"ship this"**, **"ship it"**,
**"we're done"**, **"merge this"**, **"push it"**, **"run CI"**, **"push a PR"** —
run `shipyard pr` (not `gh pr create` + `shipyard ship` separately).

`shipyard pr` is the single orchestrator (Shipyard v0.19.1+; currently pinned
in `tools/shipyard.toml`). It:

1. Calls `tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py` (resolved via Shipyard's
   `[validation]` path-discovery, explicit in `.shipyard/config.toml`) and
   hard-fails if a mapped skill path was touched without a `SKILL.md` update
   or a `Skill-Update:` trailer.
2. Calls `tools/scripts/version_bump_check.py --mode=apply` to bump SDK,
   Claude plugin, and marketplace versions consistently, honoring any
   `Version-Bump:` trailers.
3. Runs the no-build source-contract registry gate:
   `tools/import-validation/check-source-contracts.py --strict` plus
   `tools/import-validation/test_source_contracts.py`. This mirrors the
   GitHub `Versioning & Skill-Sync` workflow and the local pre-push hook.
4. Commits the bump (if any) as `chore: bump <surfaces>`.
5. Pushes the branch, creates the PR, and records Shipyard tracking state.
6. Runs cross-platform validate + merge on green.
7. Auto-release workflow (`.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`) tags and
   publishes binaries on merge. The full pipeline (tag → 5-platform build
   → sign + notarize → 11-asset publish) is documented end-to-end in
   [docs/guides/release-pipeline.md](../../../docs/guides/release-pipeline.md).
   **Keep that doc in sync when you touch any release workflow.**
   **Auto-supersede behavior**: when a new SDK tag is created, the workflow
   cancels any in-flight `release-cli.yml` / `sign-and-release.yml` runs for
   strictly-older SemVer tags and deletes their draft releases. This prevents
   the 2026-05-15 v0.101.x saga from recurring (5 bumps each queueing a full
   macos-15 darwin-arm64 build, latest waiting hours behind already-obsolete
   builds). Opt out via `vars.PULP_RELEASE_MODE=land-all` (repo-wide) or
   `Release-Supersede: skip reason="..."` trailer on the merging commit
   (per-release). See #2076 + the `release-draft-stuck-check.yml` newest-SemVer
   skip for the watchdog side of the cleanup.

Never run `gh pr create` + `shipyard ship` separately for a normal ship
cycle. Never invoke the two version/skill scripts by hand — `shipyard pr`
wires them together with the right flags.

Direct `gh pr create` is an explicit emergency/manual bypass only. If the
user asks for that path, state the tracking gap up front: the PR may not
appear in Shipyard-managed state or the macOS GUI until it is reconciled or
re-shipped through Shipyard.

`pulp pr` is a Pulp-side wrapper that delegates to `shipyard pr`; both are
valid, agents should prefer `shipyard pr` for directness. Humans can opt out
of Shipyard for their own checkout with `pulp config set pr.workflow github`
or `manual`, but agents should not choose those workflows unless the user
explicitly asks for a manual/emergency bypass. `pulp status` reports the
effective workflow and whether its required local tool is installed.

Backward compatibility: raw `shipyard ship` / `shipyard run` still work for
diagnostics, experimental branches, existing Shipyard-managed PRs, or when
`shipyard pr` itself is being debugged. Do not use them as the primary ship
path.

### Shipyard pin and behaviour notes

Pin bumps must go through `shipyard pin bump --to vX.Y.Z`, not a hand edit.
Shipyard v0.50.0+ is Rust-backed and macOS ships as an Apple-Silicon-only
signed/notarized `.dmg`, so the version and asset metadata must move together.

- **Release SDKs are expected to include desktop WebView symbols**
  (pulp #695). `.github/workflows/release-cli.yml` now configures the
  release build with `-DPULP_BUILD_WEBVIEW=ON`, installs Linux's
  `libgtk-3-dev` + `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, and verifies the staged
  `pulp-view` archive still contains `WebViewPanel` and
  `make_webview_embedded_resource_fetcher`. If you touch the release
  workflow or `tools/scripts/release-cli-local.sh`, preserve that
  contract or WebView-using downstream SDK consumers will link-fail.
- **Phase 8 CLI flip ships two CLI binaries.** Release CLI jobs must
  preserve Rust `pulp` as the user-facing binary and C++ `pulp-cpp`
  as the fallthrough delegate in the same archive. Smoke both names:
  `pulp version --json` for the Rust path, and at least one C++-owned
  command through `PULP_RS_CPP_BINARY=/path/to/pulp-cpp pulp ...` or a
  direct `pulp-cpp ...` invocation. Do not resurrect `pulp-rs` as the
  shipped binary name.
- **macOS binary is signed + notarized** (Shipyard v0.29.0). On
  macOS 26.3+ XProtect skips the deep scan for notarized binaries,
  cutting `shipyard pr` cold-start ~4-5x (from ~5-6s to ~1-1.5s).
  No pulp-side action; transparent.
- **Heartbeat line during long validation** (Shipyard v0.29.0). A
  20-minute lane now prints periodic progress instead of leaving a
  silent terminal. Helpful when watching `shipyard ship` interactively.
- **Backend errors are surfaced under the summary table** (Shipyard
  v0.28.0). A bare `ubuntu     error     ssh    12s` row used to
  give zero diagnostic signal — the captured stderr tail (bundle
  upload failure, remote `cmake` apply failure, SSH transport
  error, etc.) now prints below the table. Closes pulp #665's
  diagnosis-blind-spot complaint.
- **Worktree-local `.shipyard.local/` falls back to the primary
  checkout** (Shipyard v0.27.2). Pulp uses worktrees heavily for
  parallel agent work; without this every new worktree had to
  manually `cp .shipyard.local/config.toml` from the primary repo
  before `shipyard pr` could see the SSH host config. Now it
  inherits automatically.
- **Ship preflight runs BEFORE `gh pr create`** (Shipyard v0.27.1).
  Earlier the PR was opened first and ship aborted on unreachable
  SSH backend, leaving stranded PRs with no validation (the
  Apr 22 pattern that left several pulp PRs mid-flight). Now an
  unreachable target fails fast and the PR is never opened.
- **Daemon tunnel supervisor** (Shipyard v0.27.0). Tailscale Funnel
  transients no longer kill the daemon — the supervisor restarts
  the funnel on backoff. Periodic reconcile loop runs independently
  of per-PR polls. Both apply to the macOS GUI's webhook delivery.
- **Long-running daemons keep accepting fresh subscribers** (Shipyard
  v0.26.0). The subscribe-replay path now uses blocking `put()`
  instead of `put_nowait()`, so once the replay ring grows past 64
  events the daemon no longer silently stops handing new IPC clients
  their initial snapshot. This was the root cause of the macOS GUI
  falling back to "polling" mode and showing no active PRs after
  enough ship-state churn.
- **Daemon/CLI drift is now diagnosable over IPC** (Shipyard v0.26.0).
  IPC protocol is bumped to 2, daemon hello/status frames advertise
  the daemon's own `shipyard_version`, and `shipyard doctor` flags a
  daemon-vs-CLI version mismatch explicitly instead of leaving stale
  subscribers to fail mysteriously.
- **Auto-PR titles and bodies use the feature commit** (Shipyard v0.24.0 /
  Shipyard #151). The orchestrator walks past the mechanical
  `chore: bump versions` commit when composing the title/body, and scrubs
  the `Automated by shipyard pr.` tool-branding text. Pulp PR #624 was the
  canonical repro before the fix. Previously the auto-PR pointed at the
  bump commit — generic and uninformative. Shipped PRs now read as
  first-party.
- **`Version-Bump:` trailers are authoritative, not ceiling-raising**
  (Shipyard v0.25.0 / Shipyard #152). An author-declared
  `Version-Bump: <surface>=patch reason="..."` is no longer silently
  raised to `minor` when the conventional-commit heuristic on other
  subjects classifies the diff as `minor`. This matches the pulp-side
  behaviour in `tools/scripts/version_bump_check.py` at this pin.
- **`shipyard ship-state list` is served from the daemon via IPC** when
  `shipyard daemon` is running (Shipyard v0.25.0 / Shipyard #154). The
  PyInstaller cold-start (~5-6s) is bypassed. Callers that tight-loop
  over ship-state — the macOS GUI polls every 7s; `pulp pr` preflight
  calls it indirectly — see a meaningful CPU saving. Nothing to do at
  the pulp side; it's transparent.

### SSH preflight (v0.20.0+ / Shipyard #106)

Exit codes are distinct:

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Validation failed |
| 2 | Configuration error |
| 3 | Backend unreachable (new; surfaces within 10s with classified reason) |

The unreachable-backend error names the failure class (auth / host_key /
network / timeout / configuration / unknown) and prints the last ssh stderr.

Flags:

- `--skip-target NAME` — **DELIBERATE** lane skip (no probe runs). Use when
  you know a target is irrelevant for this PR.
- `--allow-unreachable-targets` — proceed despite an unreachable backend.
  Prints a loud `⚠︎ VALIDATION GAP: <target> skipped` banner. Use only when
  you genuinely cannot reach a backend and accept the validation gap.

Automation (crons, agents) should branch on exit code 3 specifically rather
than parsing error strings.

## Tool selection: Shipyard (primary)

**Shipyard is Pulp's primary CI tool.** All merges, validations, and
ship cycles should use Shipyard. `local_ci.py` remains in the repo as
a fallback but is scheduled for removal after a 2-week observation
period (see danielraffel/pulp#120).

```bash
# Primary: Shipyard
shipyard run                              # validate current branch
shipyard pr                               # create, track, validate, and merge on green
shipyard ship --resume                    # pick up an interrupted ship (v0.3.0+)
shipyard ship --no-resume                 # discard stale state, start fresh
shipyard ship-state list                  # in-flight ships (title, url, sha)
shipyard ship-state show <pr>             # full state for one PR
shipyard ship-state discard <pr>          # archive stale state
shipyard cleanup --ship-state --apply     # prune closed-PR + aged state
shipyard run --targets windows --smoke    # fast Windows-only check
shipyard run --resume-from test           # skip configure+build, run tests only
shipyard cloud run build <branch>         # dispatch to Namespace
shipyard rescue <PR>                      # recover a wedged PR by redispatching queued runs
shipyard rescue <PR> --rerun-failed       # also re-arm cancelled/failed runs
shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers # host-side prevention daemon for self-hosted runners
shipyard update --check --json            # installed vs latest Shipyard drift report
shipyard update                           # apply latest stable Shipyard

# Target management
shipyard targets                          # list targets with reachability
shipyard targets test windows             # probe a single target

# Config inspection
shipyard config show                      # effective merged config
shipyard config profiles                  # list profiles + active

# Fallback only (if Shipyard is broken or unavailable):
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py ship
```

### Resuming an interrupted ship (v0.3.0+)

If a ship was interrupted (laptop closed, session ended, OS restart),
run `shipyard ship` again — it auto-resumes from a per-PR state file
at `<state_dir>/ship/<pr>.json` without re-dispatching. Shipyard
refuses to resume if the PR head SHA or merge policy changed since
the state was written; re-run with `--no-resume` to discard and ship
fresh.

`shipyard ship-state list` is the self-describing inventory (PR,
title, URL, tip commit subject, dispatched-run IDs). Come back to
a week-old laptop state and still know what you were shipping.

### Fast test iteration on SSH targets

`--resume-from` now works on SSH and SSH-Windows targets. Shipyard
probes the remote for a marker file proving the previous stage
passed for the exact SHA. If found, earlier stages are skipped:

```bash
# After a full build passes, iterate on test failures only:
shipyard run --targets windows --resume-from test   # ~2 min vs 15 min

# Resume from build (skip setup + configure):
shipyard run --resume-from build
```

### macOS overflow routing (Plan B)

`.github/workflows/build.yml`'s `resolve-provider` job auto-routes the
macOS leg to Namespace when the local self-hosted Mac runner is busy.
With one local runner serving ~15 open PRs serially, this is the
difference between "PR merges in 20 min" and "PR queues for 5 hours."

**Trigger condition** (all three must hold):

- Local runner BUSY count >= `PULP_LOCAL_MAC_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD` (default `2`)
- `PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON` is set on the repo
- Event is `pull_request` (manual `workflow_dispatch` honors the operator's explicit `macos_runner_selector_json`)

When triggered, the macOS matrix leg dispatches to the Namespace
runner profile (e.g. `namespace-profile-generouscorp-macos`) instead
of the local `["self-hosted","sanitizer"]` pool. The stable `macos`
wrapper job (branch-protection's required check) doesn't change — it
gates on the matrix leg's conclusion regardless of which runner pool
served it.

**When this kicks in vs. doesn't:**

```
push to PR  →  resolve-provider runs
            →  count busy local "sanitizer" runners
            →  BUSY >= 2 AND Namespace configured?
                  ├── yes  →  macOS = namespace-profile-...
                  └── no   →  macOS = self-hosted,sanitizer (local)
```

**Inspect the decision:**

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log --repo danielraffel/pulp | grep "macOS route"
# → resolve-provider: macOS route = overflow (BUSY=2 >= 2); selector = "namespace-profile-generouscorp-macos"
```

**`shipyard rescue <PR>` still works** as a manual override for PRs
that queued before Plan B was in place, or when overflow conditions
don't match (e.g., only 1 busy runner) but you want cloud anyway.
With Plan B routing automatic, rescue is a less common tool.

**Disable temporarily** (revert all PRs to local-only):

```bash
gh variable delete PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON --repo danielraffel/pulp
```

Plan source: `planning/2026-05-13-namespace-overflow-implementation.md`
(reviewed by `/codex` 2026-05-13). Full operator docs:
`docs/guides/local-ci.md` § "macOS overflow routing".

### Release workflows: Namespace routing (post-2026-05-18 incident)

`.github/workflows/sign-and-release.yml` and `.github/workflows/release-cli.yml`
also route their macOS legs through Namespace when
`PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON` is set. Unlike `build.yml` (which
has the full overflow logic above), release workflows take a simpler
"namespace if configured, GitHub-hosted otherwise" approach via a tiny
`resolve-macos-runner` job at the top of each file.

**Why this matters:** during the 2026-05-18 SDK starvation incident,
the GitHub-hosted `macos-14` / `macos-15` queue backed up for hours and
blocked every release-cli darwin-arm64 leg and every sign-and-release
build from v0.111.0 through v0.134.0 (25 tags piled up). PR work was
already routing through Namespace post-cutover; releases were still
hitting the GitHub-hosted pool because release-cli.yml and
sign-and-release.yml had hardcoded `runs-on: macos-14` / `macos-15`.

**Fall-back behavior:** when `PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON`
is unset, both workflows revert to the previous GitHub-hosted runners —
so removing the variable doesn't break releases.

**Caveat:** this does NOT include the `PULP_LOCAL_MAC_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD`
logic from build.yml. Releases are infrequent enough that overflow isn't
the bottleneck; sending all release macOS legs to Namespace directly is
simpler and matches what the user has already configured.

See pulp #2238 (supersede cascade fix), pulp #2281 (Skia gate fix),
and the post-mortem-driven follow-up that introduced this routing.

### Per-PR macOS retargeting: `pulp macos`

The matrix in `build.yml` couples Linux/Windows/macOS into a single
`workflow_run`. Rerunning macOS via that matrix means re-running
Linux/Windows too — wasted compute when they already passed.

`build-macos.yml` is a standalone workflow (introduced in pulp task
#20) that runs JUST the macOS build/test on a chosen runner pool.
Branch protection's required `macos` check accepts the latest
same-named check from either workflow, so `build-macos.yml`'s `macos`
job supersedes the matrix's `macos` job when fresher.

```bash
# Move a PR's macOS leg to a different runner, without touching Linux/Windows:
pulp macos retarget --pr <N> --to <local|namespace|github-hosted>

# See where the latest macOS check landed and its state:
pulp macos status --pr <N>
```

`retarget` cancels any in-flight macOS-bearing workflow_runs for the
PR (from both `build.yml` and `build-macos.yml`), then fires a fresh
`gh workflow run build-macos.yml` with the chosen runner.

**When this is the right tool:**

- Local Mac just freed up and a PR is sitting queued on GH-hosted →
  `pulp macos retarget --pr N --to local` claws it back to local.
- One critical PR needs to skip the queue → `--to namespace` (billable).
- A PR's macOS leg flaked on local; retry on GH-hosted → `--to github-hosted`.

**What it doesn't do:** retargeting only swaps the macOS dispatch.
Linux/Windows from `build.yml`'s matrix keep running independently.
For full-workflow rerun (e.g. after force-push), the existing
close+reopen or `git push --force-with-lease` paths still apply.

### Opportunistic reroute daemon (task #22)

`tools/scripts/macos_reroute_watcher.py` is a long-running watcher
that automates the "local just freed up; pull a queued cloud job back
to local" pattern. Install on the host that runs the self-hosted Mac
GH Actions runner; the launchd template at
`tools/launchd/pulp-macos-reroute-watcher.plist.template` documents
the setup steps.

Polling cadence: 30s. Detection: `ps` for Runner.Worker children
under the actions-runner workspace (no admin token required). When
local is idle AND a BAT run's macOS job has cloud labels (`macos-15`
or `nscloud-*` / `namespace-profile-*`) AND hasn't started yet, the
watcher invokes `pulp macos retarget --pr N --to local`.

Flap-guard: a PR rerouted in the last 5 min is suppressed (avoids
thrashing). One reroute per tick; the next tick reassesses.

Cooperates with the overflow probe in `build.yml` — they're
complementary: the probe makes the initial dispatch decision; the
watcher catches near-misses after the fact.

### Path-scoped validation profile: `parser`

`.shipyard/config.toml` defines a `[validation.parser]` lane (pulp
#1916) for PRs that only touch runtime-import parser code — the
standalone `tools/import-design` tool, the `tools/import-validation`
scripts, the `packages/pulp-import-ir` package, parser fixtures, the
parser test files, and the `core/view/.../design_import*` family.

The lane configures with `PULP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF` and runs ctest with
`--label-include parser-import`, so plugin validators (auval /
pluginval / clap-validator, registered under `examples/pulp-*/`) and
the broader format-adapter smoke surface stay out of the loop. The
motivating failure was pulp #1910, where pluginval-PulpGain-VST3
segfaulted on a Figma Make parser PR that had no business touching the
VST3 adapter.

```bash
# Auto-select against origin/main and run the matching lane:
shipyard run --pipeline "$(python3 tools/scripts/validation_profile_select.py)"

# Inspect what the classifier decided + which paths drove it:
python3 tools/scripts/validation_profile_select.py --json

# Force the broad lane (useful when the parser scope is technically
# unchanged but you suspect cross-subsystem fallout):
shipyard run --pipeline default
```

The selector returns `parser` only when every changed path lives
inside the scope; any unrelated edit forces `default`. The bias is
toward broad validation.

`shipyard pr` does not yet auto-route to the parser lane — for a final
merge gate, let it default through `[validation.default]`. The
parser lane is for fast iteration before that final gate.

### Iterating on a single-platform failure

When CI goes red on exactly one of Pulp's platforms — e.g. only the
Windows Coverage leg of the #566 matrix, only the macOS AddressSanitizer
leg, only Linux Namespace — **do not default to pushing a fix and
waiting for the full matrix**. That re-validates `mac`, `ubuntu`, and
`windows` on every iteration when only one of them actually failed,
burning ~25 minutes of wall time and GitHub Actions runner minutes on
legs that were already green.

Use `shipyard run` with target selection against Pulp's real lanes:

```bash
# Iterate on the Windows lane only
shipyard run --skip-target mac --skip-target ubuntu --json

# Inclusive form (equivalent)
shipyard run --targets windows --json

# Chain with --resume-from when the build is already green and you're
# only iterating on test failures on that platform:
shipyard run --targets windows --resume-from test --json
```

This validates locally via Pulp's configured backend for the target
(`local` on mac, `ssh` on ubuntu, `ssh-windows` on windows) — see
`shipyard targets list` for the live mapping. Real result in ~5–10
min per target, zero GitHub Actions spend, no re-validation of lanes
you didn't touch. Once the local lane goes green, push + let CI
confirm across the full matrix; only then run `shipyard pr` for the
final merge gate.

**When this loop doesn't fit — keep using the full path:**

- **Final pre-merge gate.** `shipyard pr` is still the only thing that
  produces a merge-eligible evidence record across all three lanes.
  Local iteration gets you to green; `shipyard pr` lands it.
- **Failure specific to a GitHub-hosted lane.** The build matrix on
  main has a `macOS (ARM64) [github-hosted]` leg and `[namespace]`
  Linux/Windows legs. If a failure is specific to the github-hosted
  macOS environment, `shipyard run --targets mac` hits the local mac
  backend which is close but not identical. `shipyard cloud run build
  <branch>` dispatches to the same Namespace runners CI uses without
  re-running everything — the middle ground when you need the exact
  cloud environment.
- **Cross-target behavior you're actually testing.** If the bug only
  manifests when two targets interact (rare — e.g. shared FetchContent
  cache corruption), the single-target loop hides it. Full matrix
  only in that case.

**When `shipyard run` fails for reasons that don't match your change:**

Pulp's `ssh` (ubuntu) and `ssh-windows` (`win` alias) backends
accumulate per-run state — `.shipyard-stage-build-*`,
`.shipyard-stage-configure-*`, a stale worktree branch checkout from
an interrupted earlier run. If `shipyard run --targets windows` errors
with messages that look unrelated to the code you changed (CMake
complaining about files you didn't touch, configure steps timing out
on line one, paths pointing at an earlier branch), the host state is
suspect — your code change probably isn't wrong. Diagnose before
iterating:

On Linux (ssh ubuntu), the checkout is at `~/pulp-validate`; diagnose
with standard POSIX commands:

```bash
ssh ubuntu
cd ~/pulp-validate
git log -1 --oneline && git status --short       # expected SHA? clean worktree?
ls -la .shipyard-stage-* 2>/dev/null             # leftover stage dirs?
rm -rf .shipyard-stage-*                         # safe — shipyard re-stages from scratch
```

On Windows (ssh win), the checkout is at `C:\Users\danielraffel\pulp-validate`.
OpenSSH on Windows runs commands through `cmd.exe` by default, so use
cmd-native syntax — do NOT paste Windows-style backslash paths into a
`bash` block (backslashes get interpreted as escapes):

```bat
:: Via ssh from your Mac; each command is a separate ssh call so cmd.exe parses cleanly
ssh win "cd /d C:\Users\danielraffel\pulp-validate && git log -1 --oneline"
ssh win "cd /d C:\Users\danielraffel\pulp-validate && git status --short"
ssh win "cd /d C:\Users\danielraffel\pulp-validate && dir /b .shipyard-stage-*"
```

PowerShell is reliable for the removal step (the `for /d` cmd idiom is
fragile when shipped through ssh argv quoting):

```bash
ssh win 'powershell -NoProfile -Command "cd C:\Users\danielraffel\pulp-validate; Get-ChildItem -Directory -Filter .shipyard-stage-* | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force"'
```

On a genuinely stale host (validate worktree stuck on a several-weeks-old
commit with 20+ `.shipyard-stage-*` artefacts), combine `git fetch origin &&
git reset --hard origin/main` on the validate checkout with the stage
directory cleanup above. Re-run `shipyard run --targets <host>` after
cleanup.

### Incremental bundles (automatic)

SSH validation now sends only the git delta between the remote HEAD
and the target SHA. Typical cycles drop from ~443 MB to a few KB.
No configuration needed — falls back to full bundle automatically.

To install Shipyard locally for the first time:

```bash
./tools/install-shipyard.sh           # download + verify pinned binary
./tools/install-shipyard.sh --status  # show installed vs pinned version
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"  # add ~/.local/bin to PATH (one-time)
```

The public Pulp installer intentionally does not install Shipyard or GitHub
CLI (`gh`). Ordinary Pulp users can create, build, run, and upgrade projects
without either tool. Treat them as source-checkout contributor dependencies
for PR/CI work; `gh` is required only for GitHub-facing maintenance commands
and the explicit `pr.workflow=github` bypass.

After install, every Pulp checkout that has `~/.local/bin` on PATH gets
the same pinned Shipyard version automatically. The pin lives in
`tools/shipyard.toml` and is bumped via PR after each Shipyard release
that passes Pulp's CI matrix. Use `shipyard pin bump --to vX.Y.Z`
instead of hand-editing `tools/shipyard.toml`; the helper owns the pin
edit and worktree-safety checks.

The two tools cover the same target matrix (mac local + GitHub-hosted
Linux/Windows; legacy SSH targets only when explicitly requested) and accept
the same `--base` flag for develop branches. Shipyard adds evidence-gated
merge that checks per-platform proof for the exact merge-candidate SHA, which
is stricter than `local_ci.py`'s `job.passed` check.

## Phase 1 failure diagnostics (>= v0.58.0)

Shipyard v0.58.0 (Shipyard PR #304, 2026-05-18) replaces the lossy
`Validation failed. PR #<N> not merged.` emit with a structured failure
block carrying the failing job URL, the failing step name, and a parsed
test-framework footer (CTest by default; `failure_parser` config knob
allows opting into catch2 / pytest / go / auto in a future phase). On a
real failure you now see:

```
✗ Validation failed
  Target: mac (cloud=namespace)
  Job:    macOS (ARM64) [github-hosted]
  URL:    https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/actions/runs/<R>/job/<J>
  Step:   "Test (non-Windows)" — exit 8
  Tests:
    1236 - FontResolver: animation respects LRU cache cap (Failed)
    ...
```

Same data lands in the JSON event under `diagnostics: {...}` so
machine-readers (auto-resolution routines, agent-status dashboards)
can act on it without parsing the human text. Source design:
`https://github.com/danielraffel/Shipyard/issues/303` + the codex-
vetted comment thread there.

## Phase 2 watch diagnostics (>= v0.59.0)

Shipyard v0.59.0 (Shipyard PR #310, 2026-05-19) extends `shipyard
watch --pr N --follow` to surface the same structured failure block
on every terminal-failure transition observed during the poll. The
watch loop caches diagnostics by `(target, run_id)` so at most one
log fetch per transition fires for the lifetime of one watch
invocation. Reuses Phase 1's 256 KB log-tail cap. Both human and
JSON modes carry the diagnostics. Lets you chain
`shipyard pr && shipyard watch --pr <N>` and stop babysitting the
GitHub UI on slow CI runs.

## Recovery + maintenance toolkit (>= v0.56.2)

Three operational commands cover the prevention → recovery → maintenance
lifecycle for self-hosted-runner CI. The authoritative reference lives in
Shipyard's own `skills/ci/SKILL.md`; the commands surface from
`shipyard --help` once the pin is bumped.

### Recover: `shipyard rescue <PR>`

When a PR's matrix is stuck behind a queue jam on the self-hosted local
runner (the typical 5+ hour backlog scenario), cancel that PR's queued
runs and redispatch them to GitHub-hosted runners:

```bash
shipyard rescue 1920                  # cancel + redispatch queued runs to github-hosted
shipyard rescue 1920 --rerun-failed   # also re-arm completed/cancelled runs (watchdog-cancelled case)
shipyard rescue 1920 --dry-run        # preview without acting
shipyard rescue --all-stuck           # repo-wide
shipyard rescue 1920 --to <provider>  # default: github-hosted
```

Replaces the older 5-step gh-api cancel + cloud-handoff recipe. Use it
when a self-hosted runner is healthy but its queue is hours deep —
`gh api .../actions/runs?status=queued` will show the depth across the
repo and `ps aux | grep Runner.Worker` confirms the runner itself is
not the bottleneck.

### Prevent: `shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers`

Host-side daemon that runs continuously on each self-hosted host.
Cancels stale queued runs AND auto-kills hung `Runner.Worker`
processes via the same recovery sequence as `runner kill --pid <pid>
--yes`: snapshot → SIGTERM → grace → SIGKILL → reap children →
quarantine partial builds → verify `Runner.Listener` → optional wait
for GitHub status flip.

```bash
shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers          # implies --fix
shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers --json   # structured stream
```

Pair with launchd / systemd so the watchdog survives reboots. JSON
contract: `runner.watch` envelopes with `event=auto_kill_worker`,
`phase ∈ {attempt, killed, failed, no-pid-found}`.

Pulp's local macOS runner runs through `actions-runner` (PIDs surfaced
via `ps aux | grep Runner.Listener`); the daemon co-exists with the
existing service.

### Keep current: `shipyard update`

```bash
shipyard update --check --json   # report installed vs available (safe in CI / cron)
shipyard update                  # apply latest stable
shipyard update --to v0.56.2     # pin / rollback to a specific version
shipyard update --dry-run        # plan only
```

Replaces any documented `curl install.sh | sh` recipes — the bootstrap
form is only needed when a host has no Shipyard at all. Future
upgrades on a host that already has Shipyard installed go through
`shipyard update`.

The repo-side pin lives in `tools/shipyard.toml`; bump it with
`shipyard pin bump --to vX.Y.Z` (this triggers the ci skill-sync gate,
which is why this section exists). The pin and a developer's local
install can drift — `pulp doctor` surfaces that, and `shipyard
--version` is the local source of truth.

## Prerequisites Check

Before running any CI command, verify the required tooling AND provider config exists:

```bash
# Required
test -f tools/local-ci/local_ci.py || echo "ERROR: local CI not found — is this a recent checkout?"
command -v shipyard >/dev/null || echo "ERROR: shipyard not installed (run ./tools/install-shipyard.sh)"
command -v gh >/dev/null || echo "WARNING: gh CLI not installed; GitHub-facing fallback/triage commands will be unavailable"

# Preferred (shared machine-global local CI config)
test -f "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Pulp/local-ci/config.json" || echo "WARNING: no shared local CI config — copy tools/local-ci/config.example.json there"

# Fallback (worktree-local legacy config)
test -f tools/local-ci/config.json || echo "WARNING: no worktree fallback config.json"

# Verify GitHub Actions runner routing. Namespace handles macOS PR work
# (2026-05-18 re-commissioning); GHA-hosted handles Linux+Windows.
gh variable list -R danielraffel/pulp | grep -q '^PULP_DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER[[:space:]]*github-hosted' || echo "WARNING: PULP_DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER should be github-hosted"
gh variable list -R danielraffel/pulp | grep -q '^PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON' || echo "WARNING: PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON is missing; macOS build will use hosted macos-15"
gh variable list -R danielraffel/pulp | grep -q '^PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON' || echo "WARNING: PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON is missing; macOS overflow will not reach Namespace"
gh variable list -R danielraffel/pulp | grep -q '^PULP_LOCAL_MAC_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD[[:space:]]*0' || echo "INFO: PULP_LOCAL_MAC_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD is non-zero; macOS leg will prefer the local self-hosted Mac before overflowing to Namespace"
```

If `local_ci.py` doesn't exist, the user likely has an older checkout. Tell them to pull latest main.

## Visual Harness Container

`ci/visual-harness.Dockerfile` and `.github/workflows/visual-harness.yml`
provide the deterministic visual-harness smoke environment. The Docker image
downloads the pinned Skia `chrome/m144` Linux release asset, verifies its
SHA-256, installs the bundled Pulp fonts into fontconfig, and installs
`skia-python==144.0.post2` for the B.0 SkPicture byte-identity smoke. The
workflow runs that Linux container and also runs the same pytest smoke on
macOS arm64 so the future canonical raster lane has a platform signal. The
`macOS local smoke` job resolves `runs-on` from
`PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON` first and falls back to hosted `macos-15` only
when the local selector variable is absent. On the persistent local runner,
this job deliberately uses the installed `python3.12` and a worktree-local venv
instead of `actions/setup-python`, because that action defaults to GitHub's
hosted `/Users/runner` toolcache path and can fail before tests start.

Use it when a fresh worktree has only `external/skia-build` headers/metadata
and no platform static libraries:

```bash
tools/harness/visual/docker-build.sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/workspace" pulp-visual-harness
```

The wrapper defaults to the pinned Skia `linux-x64` lane (`linux/amd64`) and
keeps a reusable local buildx cache under
`~/.cache/pulp/visual-harness/buildx`. The Dockerfile also uses BuildKit cache
mounts for apt packages, the Skia release zip, and pip wheels, so repeated
runs on the same Mac/Ubuntu SSH host do not re-download the expensive inputs
unless the lock or digest changes. Override with `PULP_VISUAL_IMAGE`,
`PULP_VISUAL_DOCKER_PLATFORM`, or `PULP_VISUAL_DOCKER_CACHE` if a host needs a
separate cache namespace.

GitHub-hosted Ubuntu must create a `docker-container` Buildx builder before
calling the wrapper; the default `docker` driver on that image rejects
`type=local` cache export unless containerd image storage is enabled.

For macOS visual/layout jobs, do not use the combined `actions/cache` action
for `ccache` or FetchContent on the local self-hosted runner. Its home
directory persists between jobs, so GitHub cloud-cache saves can spend
20+ minutes uploading multi-GB compiler caches that the runner already has
locally. Use `actions/cache/restore` for GitHub-hosted fallback runners and
`actions/cache/save` only on non-PR `main` runs (`push` where the workflow has
a push trigger, or `workflow_dispatch` on `main` for manual cache seeding).
PRs should restore existing remote caches at most, not publish PR-scoped
ccache blobs.

The container is a reproducible smoke/developer environment. It does not
replace the future canonical arm64-darwin raster-golden gate.

## Language Correction

**IMPORTANT**: When a user says "push to main", "merge to main", or "land this", ALWAYS correct them:

> "I won't push directly to main — that bypasses review. Instead, I'll create a PR, run CI on it, and merge it if everything passes. This keeps main safe."

Then proceed with the `ship` workflow below.

## Runner Priority (hard rule)

**GitHub-hosted is the default runner provider** for Linux and Windows.
macOS routes to **Namespace** (`namespace-profile-generouscorp-macos`) by
default as of 2026-05-18 re-commissioning, with the local self-hosted Mac
(`Daniels-MacBook-Pro`) as a manual fallback the operator can force via
`workflow_dispatch macos_runner_selector_json` or by raising
`PULP_LOCAL_MAC_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD` back above 0. The required
branch-protection check on `main` is the `macos` alias job — that name MUST
NOT be renamed.

Routing variables (verify before debugging "stuck" macOS PRs):
- `PULP_DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER = github-hosted` (Linux/Windows default)
- `PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON = ["self-hosted","sanitizer"]` (local fallback selector)
- `PULP_NAMESPACE_BUILD_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON = "namespace-profile-generouscorp-macos"` (Namespace mac profile)
- `PULP_LOCAL_MAC_OVERFLOW_THRESHOLD = 0` (always overflow to Namespace)

`shipyard pr` is the authoritative ship path. Do NOT push empty commits to
retrigger a slow macOS check — the queue is paced by Namespace concurrency
limits, not stuck. If macOS is queued >45 min, check
`gh api repos/danielraffel/pulp/actions/runners` first.

## Pre-push rebase hygiene (Namespace cutover lesson)

After 2026-05-18 every macOS PR leg runs on Namespace's cloud image.
That image's environment is NOT identical to the operator's local Mac:
the bundled Skia archive (`external/skia-build/`) is absent there, so
`PULP_HAS_SKIA` is undefined and Skia-only test contracts (any test
that asserts `FontResolver::cache_size()`, paragraph layout pixel
positions, SkParagraph behavior, etc.) only hold when gated on the
macro. A test that passes locally and fails on Namespace is almost
always a missing `#ifdef PULP_HAS_SKIA` gate, not a runner problem.

Before pushing ANY branch whose CI touches a macOS leg
(`Build and Test`, `Sanitizer Tests`, `Coverage`, `Visual Harness`,
`Release-path PR gate`, `macos-15`, the `macos` alias, etc.):

```bash
git fetch origin main
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD \
  || echo "AT RISK — your branch is behind main; rebase before push"
```

If you're behind, prefer rebase over cherry-pick — main moves fast
during cutovers, and a rebase picks up all relevant invariant fixes
(not just one):

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push --force-with-lease
```

If a rebase conflicts and you can't resolve quickly, cherry-pick the
specific test gate(s) you need from main:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git checkout origin/main -- test/<the-file>.cpp
git commit -m "test(...): pull cross-environment gate from main"
PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push
```

### Don't retrigger via empty commit

`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs with `concurrency.cancel-in-progress:
true`. An empty `git commit --allow-empty && git push` cancels whatever
work the previous SHA was doing — including macOS legs that were 80%
through — and slots the new SHA to the BACK of the Namespace concurrency
queue. The correct re-run pattern when CI hit transient breakage is:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/danielraffel/pulp/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/rerun
# or to rerun only failed jobs:
gh api -X POST repos/danielraffel/pulp/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/rerun-failed-jobs
```

That keeps your SHA + queue position, only re-fires the failed legs.

### Display-name vs runner-name gotcha

The macOS matrix job is named `macOS (ARM64) [github-hosted]` even
though, post-cutover, the actual runner is `nsc-runner-*` from
Namespace. Branch protection gates on the `macos` alias job, not the
display name, so do NOT propose renaming the display name to match
reality — the alias coupling is fragile. Mention the gotcha when
explaining the routing to a new contributor.

### Verifying your branch isn't burning Namespace cycles

Two-runner pool: each failed macOS leg consumes ~10–20 min of
Namespace compute AND queues every other PR behind your run. Before
broadcasting "my CI is stuck", confirm:

```bash
# Are there Namespace runners online?
gh api repos/danielraffel/pulp/actions/runners --jq \
  '.runners[] | select(.labels[].name | contains("namespace-profile"))
   | "\(.name) status=\(.status) busy=\(.busy)"'

# What's the queue look like across all PRs?
nsc github jobs list --repository danielraffel/pulp --since 1h \
  --running --output plain
```

If your branch's macOS leg is the only thing failing, rebase. If
multiple branches are failing on the same test, file an issue — that's
a real bug in main, not your branch.

### Cancel stuck previous-SHA runs to free the queue

When you rebase + force-push, the prior SHA's matrix runs are
cancelled by `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: true` automatically. But
if you HAD also kicked off rerun-failed-jobs on the previous SHA,
those rerun attempts can still consume runner minutes. Cancel them
explicitly:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/danielraffel/pulp/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/cancel
```

The default chain (`.github/workflows/build.yml` `resolve-provider` job):

```yaml
REQUESTED_PROVIDER:
  ${{ inputs.runner_provider             # explicit workflow_dispatch input
   || vars.PULP_DEFAULT_RUNNER_PROVIDER  # repo-level override
   || 'github-hosted' }}                 # hardcoded fallback
```

Priority order:
1. **macOS local GitHub runner** — `build.yml` reads `PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON` into `EXPLICIT_MACOS_RUNNER_SELECTOR_JSON`; with the usual value `["self-hosted","sanitizer"]`, the macOS build uses Daniels-MacBook-Pro.
2. **GitHub-hosted Linux/Windows** — advisory; failures should be filed as platform issues and should not block a macOS-focused merge.
3. **Legacy SSH targets** — only when the user explicitly asks. Do not use `ssh ubuntu` or `ssh win` by default.

The `resolve_runs_on.py` optional-namespace mode must still honor explicit
selectors before checking `REQUESTED_PROVIDER`. Otherwise the local macOS repo
variable is ignored when the provider is `github-hosted`, and the required
`macos` gate falls back to hosted `macos-15`.

Build and coverage checkouts keep `lfs: false` even on macOS. The repo has
LFS attributes for historical Skia binary paths, but no current CI input is a
tracked LFS object; enabling checkout LFS on the reused self-hosted workspace
causes `git lfs install --local` to fail because Pulp already owns the
`pre-push` hook.

**Self-hosted macOS build dirs must stay isolated.** The local runner keeps
`build-*` directories between workflows. The ordinary `build.yml` matrix uses
`build-${{ matrix.key }}`, and `sanitizers.yml` uses `build-asan`,
`build-tsan`, `build-ubsan`, and `build-rtsan`. Do not collapse these back to
plain `build/`: a stale sanitizer `CMakeCache.txt` can leak flags such as
`-fsanitize=address` into the required macOS build and make unrelated
JavaScriptCore/host tests abort under ASan. `tools/scripts/test_workflow_build_dirs.py`
is wired into workflow-lint to keep this invariant machine-checked. CLI
delegation to helper binaries must resolve from the active build directory
(`build-${{ matrix.key }}` or the running CLI's sibling build tree), not a
hard-coded `build/` path; otherwise Linux catches missing helpers while warm
self-hosted macOS workspaces can mask the bug.

### Overrides when you need them

- **Dispatch a specific run on github-hosted** (normal Linux/Windows path, or comparing hosted macOS behaviour):
  ```bash
  gh workflow run build.yml --repo danielraffel/pulp --ref <branch> -f runner_provider=github-hosted
  ```
- **Pin macOS to a local runner selector**: set `PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON` at the repo level, or pass `macos_runner_selector_json` on a manual dispatch. Keep the selector compatible with the runner labels (`self-hosted`, `sanitizer`).
- **Do not use Namespace overrides**: any remaining Namespace variable or mode is stale configuration and should be removed rather than worked around.

## Commands

### Legacy `local_ci.py ship [branch]`

Historical fallback only. The normal workflow for "ship this" or "push to
main" is `shipyard pr`, which owns PR creation, Shipyard tracking state,
validation, and merge-on-green.

Use this only when debugging the legacy local CI controller itself. It does
not provide the same Shipyard state discipline as `shipyard pr`.

**Module layout (post-2026-05-17 R2-1 split):**
`tools/local-ci/local_ci.py` is the orchestrator; reusable seams have
been moved into sibling modules so newer code can import them without
pulling in the entire 11k-line file.

- `state_paths.py` — owns `state_dir()`, `queue_path()`, `results_dir()`,
  `logs_dir()`, `ensure_state_dirs()`, and the lock-path helpers.
- `normalize.py` — owns priority/validation/desktop normalization
  helpers (`normalize_priority`, `priority_value`,
  `normalize_validation_mode`, `normalize_desktop_*`, `default_desktop_*`,
  `parse_config_bool`, `infer_desktop_adapter`, `normalize_desktop_config`)
  plus the `PRIORITY_VALUES` constant.
- `git_helpers.py` — owns the git + time helpers used by the queue and
  evidence subsystems (`now_iso`, `current_branch`, `current_sha`,
  `git_root_for`, `resolve_git_ref_sha`, `short_sha`) plus the shared
  `ROOT` constant.
- `io_utils.py` — owns the I/O + locking utilities (`tail_lines`,
  `trim_line`, `atomic_write_text`, `image_change_summary`, `file_lock`)
  plus the `LockBusyError` exception. `image_change_summary` falls back
  to a SHA-256 file comparison when Pillow is missing so the test suite
  keeps running on stripped images.
- `footprint.py` — owns disk-footprint accounting helpers
  (`format_size_bytes`, `path_size_bytes`, `local_ci_state_footprint`,
  `describe_path_for_cleanup`). Used by `pulp ci-local status` and the
  cleanup paths to report how much disk the local CI state is using.
- `provenance.py` — owns provenance dict helpers (`normalize_provenance`,
  `provenance_summary`, `normalize_result`) carried on every job + result
  record. Pure functions, no I/O.
- `job_queue.py` — owns the queue persistence layer (`normalize_job`,
  `load_queue_unlocked`, `save_queue_unlocked`). Named `job_queue` (not
  `queue`) to avoid collision with the stdlib `queue` module. The
  lock-acquiring `load_queue` stays in `local_ci.py` because it pulls
  in the running-job reconcile state machine.
- `targets.py` — owns target enable/parse/resolve helpers
  (`enabled_targets`, `parse_targets_arg`, `resolve_targets`). Pure.
- `github_workflows.py` — owns the GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
  cluster: `GITHUB_ACTIONS_DEFAULTS`, `BUILTIN_GITHUB_WORKFLOWS`,
  `REPO_VARIABLE_FALLBACKS` constants + 11 resolver functions
  (`github_actions_settings_for_display`, `resolve_github_actions_settings`,
  `normalize_runs_on_json`, `resolve_workflow_runner_selector_json`,
  `resolve_workflow_dispatch_field_values`, `repo_variable_name_for_workflow_field`,
  `resolve_default_provider_for_workflow`, `resolve_workflow_field_value_and_source`,
  `resolve_workflow_dispatch_defaults`, `summarize_workflow_provider_defaults`,
  `resolve_cli_dispatch_field_values`). Pure resolution — the actual
  subprocess `gh-api` dispatch still lives in `local_ci.py`.

All original symbols are re-exported from `local_ci.py`, so any old
`mod.state_dir()` / `mod.normalize_priority()` / `mod.current_sha()` /
`mod.file_lock(...)` / `mod.BUILTIN_GITHUB_WORKFLOWS` test patch keeps
working — but new code should import directly from the sibling module
to avoid the god-module dependency.

```bash
# Legacy fallback only
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py ship [branch]

# Ship to a develop branch (for multi-piece features)
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py ship [branch] --base develop/package-manager
```

**Develop branch workflow:** When working on complex features that use a `develop/*` integration branch, PRs target the develop branch instead of main. The develop branch itself merges to main at phase boundaries. Use `--base` to specify the target.

### `run [branch]` — Just validate, no PR

Run local CI on the current branch without creating a PR or merging.

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch]
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --smoke
```

If you pass a branch name explicitly, `run [branch]` resolves that branch tip to an exact SHA before queueing. It must not silently reuse the launching checkout's `HEAD`.

Queueing now performs a submission preflight before the job is recorded:
- prints the queued worktree root, current cwd, config path/source, and per-target host intent
- rejects accidental wrong-root launches by default
- rejects obviously unreachable SSH targets by default when they have no fallback path

Override flags exist for deliberate exceptions:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --allow-root-mismatch
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --allow-unreachable-targets
```

For SSH targets, `run` uploads the exact queued SHA as a git bundle before validation, so Ubuntu and Windows do not need that branch tip to be visible on the host ahead of time.
Use `--smoke` for a fast clean install/export preflight when you want early signal before paying for the full test matrix. Smoke runs are explicitly labeled as `validation=smoke`.
If you queue a newer SHA for the same branch, targets, and validation mode, older pending work is superseded automatically.

Useful queue controls:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --targets mac
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run [branch] --smoke --targets windows
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py enqueue [branch] --priority low
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py bump <job-id> high
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target windows
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py evidence [branch]
```

If the task needs GUI/session proof instead of pure build/test validation, use the desktop automation surface on the same controller:

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop install mac
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop doctor windows --json
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop smoke mac --bundle-id com.apple.TextEdit --label textedit-smoke
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop inspect mac --command '/path/to/pulp-ui-preview' --pulp-app-automation
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop click mac --command '/path/to/pulp-ui-preview' --click-view-id bypass-toggle --capture-ui-snapshot --pulp-app-automation
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop inspect windows --command 'notepad.exe' --label notepad-inspect
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop click windows --command 'notepad.exe' --click 885,18 --capture-before --label notepad-maximize
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop inspect mac --command './build-desktop-automation/examples/ui-preview/pulp-ui-preview' --source-mode exact-sha --sha <commit-sha> --prepare-command 'cmake -S . -B build-desktop-automation && cmake --build build-desktop-automation --target pulp-ui-preview' --pulp-app-automation
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop config set target.mac.webview_driver true
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop config set target.mac.webdriver_url http://127.0.0.1:4444
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop config set target.mac.debug_attach true
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop recent mac
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop proof windows --action inspect --source-mode exact-sha --sha <commit-sha>
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py desktop publish mac --limit 5 --label mac-gallery
```

Desktop adapter truth:
- `macos-local`: local logged-in session, supports `--bundle-id` and Pulp-owned direct-app automation.
- `linux-xvfb`: `xvfb-run` GUI lane, currently `--command` + `--pulp-app-automation` for richer interaction.
- `windows-session-agent`: Scheduled Task + target-side PowerShell agent in a logged-in desktop session; supports generic `window-capture` smoke/click/inspect for normal desktop apps and reserves `--pulp-app-automation` for ViewInspector/UI-selector lanes.
- Optional WebView/debug tiers are opt-in config, not implied adapter behavior. Use `desktop status` / `desktop doctor` to confirm `optional_capabilities` before assuming `webview_dom`, `debug_attach`, `video_capture`, or `frame_stats`.

Exact-SHA desktop source guidance:
- Use `--source-mode exact-sha` when the GUI proof must match one specific commit instead of the mutable live checkout.
- Pair it with `--prepare-command` when the binary or assets must be built inside the prepared root before launch.
- Exact-SHA desktop runs persist additive provenance in `manifest.json` under `source.*` and attach `artifacts.prepare_log` when a fresh prepare step runs.
- Treat exact-SHA desktop mode as a `--command` workflow unless the adapter explicitly documents stronger support.
- Use `desktop proof` instead of ad-hoc bundle inspection when you need the latest successful GUI proof for one target/action/SHA.

### `check <PR#|URL|latest>` — Validate an existing PR

Run CI on an existing PR by number, GitHub URL, or "latest".

1. If `latest` → use `gh pr list --limit 1 --json number` to get the most recent PR
2. If URL → extract PR number from the URL
3. Fetch the PR's head branch: `gh pr view <number> --json headRefName`
4. Checkout that branch locally
5. Run local CI: `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py run <branch>` or `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py check <PR#> --smoke` for a fast preflight
6. Post results as a PR comment via `gh pr comment`

### `list` — Show open PRs

Show open PRs with summaries so the user can pick one to check or merge.

```bash
gh pr list --json number,title,author,headRefName,createdAt,labels --template '{{range .}}#{{.number}} {{.title}} ({{.headRefName}}) by {{.author.login}} {{timeago .createdAt}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

### `status` — Queue, live target state, and VM status

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py status
```

While a job is still running, `status` can show live target state for the active job, for example `mac=pass, ubuntu=pass, windows=running`. Quiet phases should now surface heartbeat and idle/liveness hints instead of looking dead by default.

### `logs [job]` — Tail a saved target log

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target windows
```

Use this when a target looks slow or stuck. The logs come from the machine-global CI state directory, so you can inspect a running job without manual SSH.

When you need to reproduce an intermittent failure locally before spending another full CI run, use:

```bash
tools/scripts/repeat-until-fail.sh 100 -- ctest --test-dir build -R "<test name>" --output-on-failure
```

### `evidence [branch]` — Show last-good exact-SHA target evidence

```bash
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py evidence
python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py evidence feature/my-branch --limit 3
```

Use this when a branch has been validated through narrow reruns and you need to know what is already proven without rerunning targets that already passed on the same SHA.

## Active CI Incident Loop

Do not treat a running CI job as something to check later. When a local CI job is active, one agent should own the monitoring loop and one agent or process should work the likely fix path locally as soon as a failure becomes actionable.

Required behavior while a job is active:
- Poll `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py status` proactively.
- Tail `python3 tools/local-ci/local_ci.py logs <job-id> --target <name>` as soon as a target fails or looks stuck.
- Send user updates without waiting to be asked when a target changes state, a failure appears, or a rerun is queued.
- If one target has already failed, stop treating the rest of that job as the only source of truth. Start local repro or code inspection immediately when the failure is actionable.
- Once a failure is actionable, parallel work is required unless it would contend with the same host or invalidate the active run. Keep one CI owner watching the hosts and one local loop reproducing or patching the likely issue.
- Do not sit idle waiting for unrelated targets to finish if the first failing target already tells you what to investigate.
- Never rerun a target that already passed on the exact same SHA unless the prior result is untrustworthy or the environment changed.
- If only part of the matrix is stale, rerun only that subset of targets.
- Once the failure surface is isolated, prefer the minimum sufficient proof instead of a symmetric rerun. If macOS and Ubuntu already passed on the current head and only Windows changed or failed, rerun Windows only.
- A direct exact-SHA validation on one target is acceptable merge evidence for that target. Do not invalidate earlier same-SHA passes on other targets just because they came from a different run.
- Use `validation=smoke` before full CI when the risk is install/export/build structure rather than runtime test behavior.
- Treat `all targets on one SHA` as a goal, not a reason to blindly rerun already-green same-SHA targets.
- On persistent local/self-hosted targets, prefer prepared same-SHA reruns for narrow follow-up validation and make `prepared=clean` vs `prepared=reused` visible in status/logs.
- Prefer the shared machine-global CI config (`state_dir()/config.json`; on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Pulp/local-ci/config.json`) so every worktree sees the same host map by default.
- Treat worktree-local `tools/local-ci/config.json` as a fallback or temporary override only. Hostnames and `repo_path` values can drift between worktrees.
- Pay attention to the submission preflight. If it says the cwd git root and queued worktree root differ, stop and fix that unless the mismatch is intentional.
- If preflight reports shared-state vs worktree-local config drift for the selected targets, treat that as a real warning, not cosmetic noise.
- For Windows SSH validation, prefer the configured target whose non-interactive PowerShell context resolves `git`, `cmake`, and `ctest`. Do not encode developer-specific host aliases in shared instructions; keep the selection criteria generic and environment-driven.
- If a dead runner left behind a stale Windows validator, let the queue reclaim that specific remote validator before starting fresh work; treat that cleanup as part of the truthful narrow-rerun path, not as ad hoc manual SSH.
- If a stale same-host job is still compiling an obsolete SHA or path, stop that stale process tree before spending more time diagnosing contention on the current run.

Minimum incident response once a failure is visible:
1. Capture the failing job id, target, SHA, validation mode, and first failing test/build step.
2. Decide whether the failure is infrastructure, environment drift, or a likely code/test issue.
3. If actionable, begin the fix or repro loop immediately instead of waiting for the whole matrix to finish.
4. Queue the narrowest truthful rerun needed after the fix.
5. Close the loop with a short status update that says what failed, what is being tried now, and what still remains.

### `cloud run [branch]` — Trigger GitHub Actions

Trigger cloud CI only when cloud CI is actually needed, for example
workflow-semantics changes, release validation, or a neutral-host confirmation
that local CI cannot provide. Prefer the built-in `pulp ci-local cloud ...`
surface instead of raw `gh workflow run`:

```bash
pulp ci-local cloud workflows
pulp ci-local cloud defaults
pulp ci-local cloud history
pulp ci-local cloud compare build
pulp ci-local cloud recommend build
pulp ci-local cloud run build <branch>
pulp ci-local cloud run validate <branch>
pulp ci-local cloud run docs-check <branch> --provider namespace
```

### `cloud status` — Check GitHub Actions

```bash
pulp ci-local cloud status
pulp ci-local cloud status latest --refresh
```

`cloud defaults` is the companion visibility command when you need to see the
current effective workflow/provider defaults and where Namespace selectors are
coming from before dispatching a run.

`cloud history`, `cloud compare`, and `cloud recommend` are the next visibility
layer when you need saved timing/provider evidence from earlier runs. Any cost
number shown there is `estimated; verify provider pricing`.

Use raw `gh workflow run` / `gh run view` only as a fallback when debugging the
GitHub side of the operator surface itself.

Provider truth rules:
- If a Namespace cloud dispatch fails before any matrix leg starts, inspect the GitHub run annotations and `resolve-provider` job result before blaming repo code.
- Treat provider CLI health, GitHub dispatch health, and provider billing/spend gates as separate failure surfaces.
- If cloud dispatch is blocked by billing or provider control-plane issues, cut over to the narrowest truthful local/SSH proof instead of retrying the same blocked dispatch loop.

## Configuration

Config is machine-global by default at `state_dir()/config.json` (on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Pulp/local-ci/config.json`).
`tools/local-ci/config.json` is the gitignored fallback, and `PULP_LOCAL_CI_CONFIG` overrides both.
Template at `tools/local-ci/config.example.json`.

Key fields:
- `targets.mac.enabled` — run local Mac validation (default: true)
- `targets.ubuntu` — SSH target for Linux validation
- `targets.windows` — SSH target for Windows validation
- `targets.<name>.host` — primary SSH host alias
- `targets.<name>.fallback_host` — optional secondary SSH host alias if the primary is unreachable
- `targets.<name>.utm_fallback` — optional UTM VM to boot only if SSH hosts are unreachable
- `targets.windows.cmake_generator` / `targets.windows.cmake_platform` — optional Windows CMake generator settings; if `cmake_platform` is omitted the runner infers `ARM64` vs `x64` from the remote host
- `targets.windows.cmake_generator_instance` — optional explicit Visual Studio instance path; if omitted the runner prefers a full VS install over `BuildTools` when both exist
- `defaults.priority` — default queue priority for `run` and `enqueue`
- `defaults.ship_priority` — default queue priority for `ship`
- `defaults.check_priority` — default queue priority for `check`
- `github_actions.repository` — optional `owner/repo` override for cloud commands
- `github_actions.defaults.workflow` — default workflow key for `cloud run`
- `github_actions.defaults.provider` — default cloud runner provider
- `github_actions.defaults.wait_poll_secs` — cloud wait polling interval
- `github_actions.defaults.match_timeout_secs` — dispatch-to-run match timeout

Keep hostnames and VM names local. Shared repo docs and skills should describe how to choose a target, not which personal alias to use.

## Documentation

Full setup guide: `docs/guides/local-ci.md`
SSH key setup for Windows/Linux VMs: `docs/guides/local-ci.md` § "Set up SSH keys"

**Docs-site CI workflows:**

- `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml` — builds + deploys the Pulp docs
  site to GitHub Pages. As of #577 PR 4 this is **MkDocs Material only**:
  the legacy `tools/build-docs.py` generator and the
  `use_legacy_generator` workflow_dispatch fallback have both been
  deleted. Rollback, if ever needed, is via `git revert` of the
  deletion commit, not a runtime toggle. Pagefind is gone (Material
  ships its own built-in search). The workflow also invokes
  `tools/build-api-docs.sh`, which pulls the current SDK version from
  `CMakeLists.txt` and injects it into Doxygen's `PROJECT_NUMBER`.
- `.github/workflows/docs-material.yml` — parallel MkDocs Material build
  (PR-only preview) added under #577 PR 1 and extended in PR 2 to build
  Doxygen + merge `api/` into the artifact and run the
  `tools/mkdocs_hooks.py` pre-build drift checks (`docs_generate.py
  check` + `check-docs-consistency.py`) plus the URL-flatten hook. Runs
  on `pull_request` and `push` when the same docs paths change.
  **No deploy** — uploads `build/site-material/` as a 14-day artifact
  for visual review. Kept as a PR-lane preview after PR 3 so reviewers
  see rendered output before it hits production.

## Required-check ruleset (issue #462)

The branch-protection ruleset for `main` is checked into the repo at
`.github/rulesets/main-protection.json` so drift between the GitHub
ruleset UI and repo intent is visible in PR review. Pattern inspired
by [Astral's ruleset-as-code approach](https://gist.github.com/woodruffw/643a6cf70ad72d404ce6f9f333181cf8).

**Fast lane — required (blocks merge):**

- `macos` — macOS build+test leg of `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `linux` — Linux (x64) build+test leg of `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `windows` — Windows (x64) build+test leg of `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- `Enforce version & skill sync` — `.github/workflows/version-skill-check.yml`

The three platform names are intentionally declared as **stable aliases**
so the merge contract survives runner-provider swaps (github-hosted ↔
namespace). The concrete context strings in `build.yml` today resolve
to e.g. `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`, which is not stable; landing the
alias layer is part of #462.

**Slow lane — advisory (does NOT block merge):**

- `AddressSanitizer (macOS ARM64)`
- `ThreadSanitizer (macOS ARM64)`
- `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (macOS ARM64)`
- `RealtimeSanitizer (Linux x86_64, Clang 18)`

These run via `.github/workflows/sanitizers.yml` on `workflow_dispatch`
only and are tracked in the checked-in JSON under `advisory_status_checks`
for visibility/drift, never inside `rules[].required_status_checks`.

**Drift enforcement:** `.github/workflows/ruleset-drift-check.yml` runs
on PR (when `.github/rulesets/**` changes) and weekly on cron. It fetches
the live ruleset via `gh api /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets` and diffs
against the checked-in JSON. PR runs post/update a single comment; the
cron job fails loudly on drift so it shows up as a red check on `main`.

**Making a change to required checks:** always edit the JSON first, open
a PR, and let the drift-check workflow confirm the plan. Then mirror the
change in the GitHub ruleset UI (or reapply via `gh api PUT`). Never edit
the live ruleset in isolation — the next scheduled drift run will fail.

### Install consumer smoke (`install-consumer-smoke.yml`)

Pulp #2087 piggyback. Catches the class of bug where in-tree builds
work but installed-SDK consumers break at configure time. Runs on
macos-15 + ubuntu-24.04: builds Pulp, `cmake --install`s it to a temp
prefix, then configures a minimal downstream `find_package(Pulp)` +
`pulp_add_plugin(...)` project against that prefix. Failures here
match what a real downstream (e.g. Spectr) would hit.

Defense-in-depth guard: greps the installed CMake config files for
`${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/cmake/...` or `${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/core/...` —
those patterns inside files that ship in the SDK tarball resolve to
the *consumer's* source tree at find_package time, never Pulp's.
Inside a function body in `tools/cmake/PulpUtils.cmake`, use
`CMAKE_CURRENT_FUNCTION_LIST_DIR`; at top level of a config file,
use `CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR`. The two existing helpers paths
(`_pulp_add_standalone` for fontconfig, top-level fallbacks for
`_PULP_FORMAT_SOURCE_DIR` etc.) demonstrate the pattern.

## Versioning & Skill-Sync gates (Layer 3)

`pulp pr` orchestrates the full shipping flow. CI enforces three gates on every PR to `main`:

- `.github/workflows/version-skill-check.yml` — runs `tools/scripts/version_bump_check.py`, `tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py`, and (since #1029) `tools/scripts/compat_sync_check.py` in `--mode=report`. Failure blocks merge. No bypass except the commit trailers documented in `docs/guides/versioning.md` and `docs/guides/compat-sync.md`.
- `.shipyard/config.toml` → `[validation.gates]` pipeline — same scripts via `shipyard run --pipeline gates`. Runs with `PULP_ENFORCE_PREPUSH=1` so warnings become errors.

Locally:

- `.githooks/pre-push` (install via `tools/scripts/install-githooks.sh`) runs all three scripts advisory-by-default. `PULP_ENFORCE_PREPUSH=1` upgrades to hard fail; `PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1` is the single-push emergency bypass.
- `tools/scripts/gates.sh` — on-demand runner for JUST the cheap gates (skill-sync + version-bump + compat-sync + deps-audit). Runs in ~1 second, exits non-zero on any failure with a one-liner pointing at the right surgical bypass. Use it before `git push` when you've made changes that might touch mapped paths but you don't want to wait for the pre-push hook OR the 20-minute CI roundtrip. Independent of the git hook (no install step needed). Named to align with Shipyard's planned `shipyard gates` subcommand (see `planning/2026-05-19-shipyard-preflight-upstream-proposal.md`); avoids collision with Shipyard's existing `preflight` namespace (SSH backend reachability probes).

**Bypass-priority cheat sheet** — reach for the surgical knob first; the nuclear one masks fast checks too:

| Symptom                                  | Surgical bypass                              | Nuclear bypass (avoid)        |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `diff-cover` is the only failing gate    | `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1 git push` | `PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push` |
| skill-sync / version-bump / compat-sync  | fix the gate, OR add the documented trailer (`Skill-Update: skip …`, `Version-Bump: skip …`, `Compat-Update: skip …`) on the tip commit | `PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push` |
| Rebase race after force-push (gates already ran cleanly on the pre-rebase tip) | `PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push --force-with-lease` (the legitimate use of the nuclear bypass — gates already passed on the same content) | — |
| All gates advisory, don't fail my push   | `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_GATES=1 git push`      | `PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1 git push` |

The 2026-05-18 Pulp #2374 lesson: `PULP_SKIP_PREPUSH=1` on a NEW commit (not a rebase) skipped skill-sync, the missed SKILL.md update caught the PR in CI ~20 minutes later, and burned a CI roundtrip. Running `tools/scripts/gates.sh` before `git push` would have surfaced it in ~200ms.

**Gotcha:** changing anything under `.github/workflows/**`, `tools/shipyard.toml`, `.shipyard/**`, `.githooks/**`, `tools/install-shipyard.sh`, or `tools/scripts/install-githooks.sh` triggers the skill-sync gate for the `ci` skill — keep this file in sync when those paths move. The map lives at `tools/scripts/skill_path_map.json`.

**Compat-sync (#1029):** `tools/scripts/compat_sync_check.py` is the new third leg, mirroring the skill-sync / version-bump shape for the `compat.json` matrix at the repo root. The bypass trailer is `Compat-Update: skip prefix=<section|*> reason="..."` (multiple lines allowed). Path map: `tools/scripts/compat_path_map.json`. Until #1027 ships the populated matrix, empty `compat.json` sections are tolerated. See `docs/guides/compat-sync.md` for the full design.

**CLI ↔ MCP parity (pulp #1997):** `tools/scripts/check_cli_mcp_parity.py` is the fourth invariant gate, added by pulp #1997. It enforces that every top-level CLI command added to `tools/cli/pulp_cli.cpp` either gets a matching `pulp_<command>` tool in `tools/mcp/pulp_mcp.cpp` OR an entry in `tools/scripts/cli_mcp_parity_baseline.json` with a one-line reason. Whole-tree check (no diff base needed) — runs as the `CLI ↔ MCP parity check` step in `version-skill-check.yml` in `--mode=report` (hard fail) and as a hint in `hooks/scripts/cli-plugin-sync.sh`. There is no commit-trailer bypass — the baseline file is itself the bypass mechanism. To intentionally defer MCP exposure for a new CLI command, add an entry to `cli_mcp_parity_baseline.json` in the same PR. The full guidance lives in the `cli-maintenance` skill ("Decide: does this need an MCP tool?").

**Auto-release:** `.github/workflows/auto-release.yml` fires on push to `main`. It diffs the two version-bearing files (`CMakeLists.txt` project version, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version) against the previous push range and creates the corresponding `v<x.y.z>` or `plugin-v<x.y.z>` tag. The existing tag-triggered release workflows (`release-cli.yml`, `sign-and-release.yml`) then build and publish. `Release: skip reason="..."` on the merging commit suppresses the tag.

**fix/feat-needs-bump (issue #1009):** the version-skill-check workflow ALSO runs `version_bump_check.py --require-bump-for-fix-feat` on `pull_request` events. If the PR title matches `^(fix|feat)(\([^)]*\))?!?:\s` (Conventional Commits user-facing prefix), the diff range MUST contain either a commit subject `chore: bump versions` OR a top-level `Version-Bump: skip reason="..."` trailer (with non-empty reason — bare `skip` is rejected). This is the structural fix for the 2026-04-30 incident (PR #1008) where a `fix(view):` merged via `gh pr merge` after a force-push race with `shipyard pr` and stranded the change on main. Auto-release.yml has a matching backstop step (`Stranded fix/feat detector`) that emits a `::warning::` annotation and opens a `release-stuck`-labelled tracking issue when the merge slips through to push. Branch protection on `main` requiring the `Enforce version & skill sync` check would close the loop entirely — see `docs/guides/release-watchdog.md` for the recommended setup. Bypass the check on a one-off basis with `Version-Bump: skip reason="..."` on any commit in the range; this is intentionally a different trailer from `Release: skip` so a "don't tag this release" decision doesn't silently imply "this fix doesn't need a bump."

**Exact bump-marker format:** for `fix:` / `feat:` PR titles, the accepted
commit subject prefixes are exactly `chore: bump versions` (canonical) and
`chore(versions): bump` (legacy). A manually authored subject such as
`chore: bump SDK to v0.78.4` does not satisfy the gate, even if the
version files and changelog are correctly edited. Let `shipyard pr` create
the bump commit when possible; if you need to repair it manually, use the
canonical subject `chore: bump versions`.

**Release-workflow VST3 pin:** `sign-and-release.yml` must clone the same Steinberg tag pinned everywhere else in the repo: `v3.7.12_build_20`. The shorthand `v3.7.12` does not exist upstream and will make tag-time macOS release jobs fail before configure/build even start.

**Release-workflow ctest must skip the `validation` label (#720):** the `Test` step in `sign-and-release.yml` MUST pass `-LE validation` to ctest. Without it, the suite includes the `auval-Pulp*` tests that copy a fresh `.component` to `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/` and immediately call `auval`. Hosted GitHub macOS runners' `AudioComponentRegistrar` does not pick up the new bundle reliably, so auval returns `Cannot get Component's Name strings / Error -50`, the Test step exits non-zero, and the entire sign / notarize / publish pipeline silently fails. This was the failure mode of the 30+ consecutive sign-and-release runs preceding v0.41.0. The validation gates are owned by `validate.yml` on PR; do not duplicate them into the release workflow. `tools/scripts/test_release_workflow_test_step.py` (wired into `workflow-lint.yml`) is the regression test that prevents reintroduction.

**Tag safety:** the auto-release workflow is idempotent-strict — if a tag already exists pointing at a different SHA, it fails loudly rather than overwriting. See `docs/guides/versioning.md` for the manual recovery recipe.

**Shared-source priming is retry-wrapped (#1375):** every `ensure_shared_git_source` call in `setup.sh` runs through `ensure_shared_git_source_with_retry` (3 attempts, 5s/10s/20s backoff, scrubs the partial cache target between attempts). Motivated by v0.74.0 + v0.74.1 release-cli runs both dying on `windows-arm64` mid-`Priming shared Yoga source cache` with exit 127 — a transient command-not-found on a Windows shell wrapper. The retry happens at the WRAPPER level, not inside `ensure_shared_git_source`, because that function uses a `set -e` subshell which a 127 tears down before any inner retry can engage. Override attempts via `PULP_PRIMING_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=N`.

**Per-tag release-cli watchdog (#1375):** `.github/workflows/release-cli-watchdog.yml` triggers on `workflow_run` for `release-cli.yml`. It resolves the tag from `head_branch`, queries the GitHub release for `pulp-sdk-*` and `pulp-{darwin,linux,windows}-*` assets via `gh release view`, and opens a per-tag tracker on three failure shapes: `run_failure`, `success_with_missing_assets` (the v0.74.0 pattern — release exists with only plugin .pkg files from `sign-and-release.yml`), `no_release` (the v0.74.1 pattern — `release-cli`'s `release` job never ran because `build-cli`/`smoke-cli` failed). The tracker's body suggests `gh workflow run release-cli.yml --ref vX.Y.Z -f version=vX.Y.Z` to backfill, and auto-closes when the SDK assets land. This is documented as Layer 2b in `docs/guides/release-watchdog.md`.

**Linux release-cli requires libfontconfig1-dev (#1970):** chrome/m144 Skia exposes fontconfig symbols that the previous release kept private. Without `libfontconfig1-dev` in the apt-install step, the Linux link fails on `undefined reference to FcInitLoadConfigAndFonts` et al. Both `release-cli.yml` and `build.yml` Linux deps steps install it. When bumping `tools/deps/manifest.json` Skia pin, run `nm -D` over the new `libskia.a` and grep for unfamiliar prefixes (`Fc`, `Hb`, `FT_`, etc.) — any new symbol class means a matching system package needs to be added.

**Safe backfill of a stuck release-cli tag (#1962):** raw `gh workflow run release-cli.yml --ref vX.Y.Z` re-runs the BROKEN workflow file from the tag's source — useless when the breakage is in the workflow or the scripts it calls. `release-cli.yml` now exposes a `source_ref` `workflow_dispatch` input plus a `build-cli` step that overlays the current `main` copy of `tools/scripts/fetch_skia_for_release.py` over the in-tree copy on every dispatch with `source_ref` set. To backfill a tag whose source predates a fetch-script fix on main:

```
gh workflow run release-cli.yml --ref main \
    -f version=v0.97.0 -f source_ref=v0.97.0
```

The workflow file comes from main (fixed), the source tree comes from the tag (correct content), and the overlay step picks up post-tag script fixes automatically. `release-guard.yml` and `release-cli-watchdog.yml` will auto-close their trackers when the SDK assets land. This was the fix for the four-day stall on v0.95.0..v0.97.0 caused by a skia-builder chrome/m144 zip layout drift (`Release/<arch>/libskia.a` instead of `Release/libskia.a`). The fetch script flattens the arch subdir; regression coverage lives in `tools/scripts/test_fetch_skia_for_release.py`.

**`RELEASE_BOT_TOKEN` is required for the auto-release chain to fire.** Without it, auto-release silently degrades — tags get created via `GITHUB_TOKEN` but GitHub doesn't trigger workflows on `GITHUB_TOKEN`-pushed tags, so `release-cli.yml` and `sign-and-release.yml` never run and no GitHub Release appears. Run `pulp doctor` to check; if missing, follow the "One-time setup" section in `docs/guides/versioning.md`. `pulp pr` will also print a heads-up before pushing the PR if the secret isn't present.

**Tarball smoke matrix exercises `pulp-mcp` too.** The CLI
tarball now ships three user-facing binaries (`pulp`, `pulp-cpp`,
`pulp-mcp`). `release-cli.yml`'s `smoke-cli` job invokes
`pulp-mcp --version` (not `pulp-mcp help` — pulp-mcp is a JSON-RPC
stdin server and `--version` is the only short-circuit that exits
cleanly without consuming stdin). When adding a new user-facing
tarball binary, follow the same pattern: pick a flag that exits 0
without touching stdin, add it to the smoke matrix's `artCmd` /
`smoke_cmd` table on BOTH the Unix and Windows steps, and confirm the
binary is stripped on Unix. Smoke-gating a real protocol exchange
would make CI flakier than it needs to be.

## Coverage workflow (`#566` Phase 1)

`.github/workflows/coverage.yml` has three jobs:

- `resolve-runners` — shared-helper resolver (`tools/scripts/resolve_runs_on.py`) that picks per-OS runs-on labels in priority order: workflow_dispatch input → `PULP_COVERAGE_<OS>_RUNS_ON_JSON` repo variable → hard-coded default (`ubuntu-latest` / `macos-latest` / `windows-latest`). Same pattern as `sanitizers.yml`. Change runner for one OS by setting the repo variable — no workflow edit required.
- `coverage` — matrix over {linux, macos, windows}. Every leg builds with Clang source-based coverage, runs the native test suite, uploads HTML + summary + Cobertura artifacts, and pushes to Codecov with exactly one per-OS flag (`os-linux`, `os-macos`, `os-windows`). The Linux leg also installs `coverage.py >= 7.10`, runs `tools/scripts/run_python_coverage.py` for `tools/scripts/**`, `tools/deps/**`, and `tools/local-ci/**`, uploads the Python HTML + summary + Cobertura artifacts, and includes `build-coverage/python/coverage.python.xml` in the same Codecov upload. The macOS leg additionally runs `tools/scripts/run_swift_coverage.py`, stages `build-coverage/apple/coverage.apple.json`, uploads the Apple summary artifact, and includes that JSON in the same Codecov upload. Subsystem / platform / surface slicing comes from `codecov.yml`'s `component_management` path globs, not from a multi-flag CSV on the upload step. Has `continue-on-error: true` on the heavy coverage steps and `fail-fast: false` on the matrix — a flake on any one OS never cancels the others and never blocks a merge.
- `coverage-diff-gate` — downloads all three OS Cobertura artifacts (`coverage-cobertura-${sha}` for Linux, `coverage-cobertura-macos-${sha}`, `coverage-cobertura-windows-${sha}`), merges them with `tools/scripts/merge_cobertura.py` (taking `max(hits)` per `(filename, line)`), then runs `diff-cover --fail-under=75` against `origin/<base>` on the merged XML. Hard-fails the PR when the global diff-coverage floor is missed. The job still renders and upserts the diff-coverage PR comment via `tools/scripts/coverage_diff_comment.py` even on failure, and it also runs the per-tier gate (`tools/scripts/coverage_tier_check.py`) in advisory mode against the same merged XML.

Gotchas:

- **Fork PRs**: the comment-upsert step has an `if:` guard skipping forks because `GITHUB_TOKEN` is read-only on fork heads; otherwise the comment step would hard-fail with 403 after the gate result is already known.
- **The comment renderer is unit-tested.** When touching `tools/scripts/coverage_diff_comment.py`, run `python3 tools/scripts/test_coverage_diff_comment.py` locally — the workflow also runs it as a pre-flight fixture check so a regression fails fast.
- **The Python tools lane is still Linux-only, but no longer scripts-only.** Today it measures `tools/scripts/**`, `tools/deps/**`, and `tools/local-ci/**`, uses coverage.py's subprocess patching so spawned scripts count, and uploads only on Linux. Python elsewhere (for example top-level `tools/*.py`, `tools/packages/**`, repo-root scripts) is still out of scope until a follow-up expands the surface again.
- **Install Python coverage tooling in a venv, not with `pip install --user`.** Namespace/self-hosted Linux runners can enforce PEP 668 (`externally-managed-environment`), which breaks the coverage lane before `tools/scripts/run_python_coverage.py` even starts. The workflow now creates `build-coverage/python-venv` and runs the Python coverage script through that interpreter; keep future edits on that pattern.
- **The Apple Swift lane is source-only on the macOS leg.** `tools/scripts/run_swift_coverage.py` stages SwiftPM's Codecov JSON for `apple/Sources/PulpSwift/**`; `apple/Tests/**` and generated `apple/.build/**` paths are ignored in `codecov.yml` so the Apple component reflects package sources rather than the test harness. iOS-only files that compile out of the macOS SwiftPM build remain out of scope on this first pass.
- **Adding a new core subsystem** means adding or adjusting the `component_management` path entry in `codecov.yml` and documenting it in `docs/guides/coverage.md`. The upload step itself should still stay at one per-OS flag per upload — Codecov rejected the older "20 flags per upload" shape.
- **Per-OS coverage (Phase 1 PR 4)**: each matrix leg tags its Codecov upload with an OS flag so `host AND os-windows` answers "what fraction of `core/host` is exercised when tests run on Windows?" — a different question from `host AND windows` (which is "what fraction of `core/host/**/windows/` shim files are covered at all"). Cross-OS unions of the same file happen at the Codecov flag layer, NOT via `llvm-profdata merge` (not architecture-portable — see planning decision doc §7).
- **Windows coverage uses Clang, not MSVC.** `tools/cmake/PulpInstrumentation.cmake` rejects MSVC because `/fsanitize-coverage` and llvm-cov emit incompatible profile shapes. The Windows matrix leg adds `C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin` to PATH and builds with clang++; the `windows-msvc-release-gate` job in `build.yml` keeps the MSVC release-path green separately.
- **diff-cover consumes a merged XML, not the per-OS ones.** It's a single-XML tool — running it against three XMLs would produce three PR comments for the same metric with slightly different numbers, more noise than signal. The merge happens once in the job (`merge_cobertura.py`, max-hits-per-line union) so the gate sees a cross-platform view while diff-cover still emits one comment. Earlier the gate read only the Linux artifact and silently skipped Apple-only / Windows-only files (pulp#635). Local `scripts/run_coverage.sh` still produces a single per-host XML; a local diff-cover invocation against that has the original silent-skip and is best treated as a sanity check, not the authoritative gate.
- **Global vs per-tier enforcement**: `diff-cover --fail-under=75` is already required. The per-tier gate is still `continue-on-error: true` while the tier definitions soak; don't silently flip that to required without updating `docs/guides/coverage.md` and the issue trail.
- **Don't `|| ...` the `merge_cobertura` step in `coverage-diff-gate`.** The script uses a DEDICATED exit code (2 = `EXIT_ALL_INPUTS_MISSING`) for the intentionally-tolerated "every input XML missing or empty" case; the diff-cover step then renders the no-XML fallback. Any other non-zero exit (1 = real error: parse failure, script bug, IO error) MUST fail the gate — otherwise a corrupted artifact silently bypasses the required 75% diff-coverage check. Codex P1 reviews on both PR #654 (original `|| echo` shape masked everything) and PR #660 (collapsing rc==1 into the tolerated case let `xml.etree.ParseError` slip through) drove the current shape. The workflow branches on the exact code with `if rc -eq 0` / `elif rc -eq 2` / `else fail`. The script's `EXIT_ALL_INPUTS_MISSING` constant + the workflow's literal `2` are paired — change them in lockstep, and add fixture-tests in `test_merge_cobertura.py` if you alter the contract.
- **Local mirror of the diff-cover gate.** `tools/scripts/local_diff_cover.sh` runs the same `diff-cover --fail-under=$THRESHOLD` flow CI runs, so coverage-only failures don't cost a 20-min CI roundtrip. The threshold + filters are read from `tools/scripts/coverage_config.json` — both the workflow's diff-cover step and the local script consume that file, so editing the JSON in one place keeps CI + local + the pre-push hook in lockstep. Bypass with `PULP_SKIP_DIFF_COVER=1` for workflow-only or doc-only PRs. The Claude Code `/coverage-diff` slash command and `pulp coverage diff` CLI subcommand are thin wrappers over the same script. The pre-push hook runs this check enforcing-by-default; `PULP_DISABLE_PREPUSH_DIFF_COVER=1` demotes it to advisory for an intentional one-push escape hatch. For focused PRs, pass build targets and set `PULP_DIFF_COVER_CTEST_REGEX` to run only the relevant CTest subset while still enforcing the shared 75% floor. Test coverage in `tools/scripts/test_local_diff_cover.py` includes anti-drift gates that fail if a future edit hardcodes `--fail-under=NN` back into `coverage.yml` or drops the targeted CTest selector.
- **`diff_cover_excludes` pattern + flag-shape contract** (PR #1005, learned the hard way). diff-cover's `--exclude` is `nargs='+'` with default action — repeated `--exclude=foo --exclude=bar` keeps only the LAST entry. AND its matching is fnmatch against (a) the file's basename and (b) its absolute path; a literal relative path like `tools/cli/cmd_loop.cpp` matches NEITHER and is a silent no-op. So entries in `coverage_config.json` MUST be a basename (`cmd_loop.cpp`) or a glob (`**/cmd_loop.cpp`), and both `local_diff_cover.sh` and `coverage.yml` MUST splat them under a SINGLE `--exclude val1 val2 ...` flag (NOT a per-entry `--exclude=PATH` loop). The previous shape was silent-broken since #919; a new exclude (scanner_clap.cpp) on PR #1005 surfaced the latent bug because it was a 2-entry config that suddenly mattered. Don't introduce a 3-entry config without re-checking that the splatted form still works.
- **llvm-cov mis-attribution: inline header virtuals + `break;` inside nested `if`** (PR #2120 case study). llvm-cov-export's Cobertura sometimes reports lines as uncovered when a passing test demonstrably executes them. Two known shapes:
    1. **Inline virtual function bodies in headers** (e.g. `virtual bool accepts_text_input() const { return false; }`) get 0% attribution when the test calls them through a base pointer. Move the body to the matching `.cpp` file (keep the declaration in the header) and coverage attributes correctly.
    2. **`break;` inside a nested `if` inside a loop.** `for(...) { if (match) { if (suppress) break; handle(); } }` may report the `break` line as uncovered even when the suppression branch is observably hit. Flatten to `for(...) { if (!match) continue; if (suppress) break; handle(); }` — same semantics, instrumented cleanly.
  Before refactoring code to satisfy diff-cover, **open `build-coverage/coverage/index.html`** and confirm whether the lines are genuinely unexercised or whether llvm-cov is misattributing. Adding tests that don't actually reach the lines won't help if the attribution itself is broken. Do NOT expand `diff_cover_excludes` to paper over instrumentation quirks — that mechanism is for thin dispatchers exercised end-to-end via shell-out tests, not for "the tooling is confused." Full write-up: `docs/guides/coverage.md` § "llvm-cov mis-attribution gotchas".
- **`merge_cobertura.py` normalises Windows backslash paths and applies `COVERAGE_IGNORE_REGEX` itself.** Two sneaky bugs found together on PR #660 by walking the actual merged XML: (1) the Windows cobertura emits filenames with backslash separators (`core\\format\\src\\clap_adapter.cpp`), Linux/macOS use forward slashes — without normalisation the merge stores them as TWO files and diff-cover matches the backslash variant against the git diff (which uses forward slashes), finding 0 hits and silently reporting 0% on cross-platform code that was actually exercised on Linux. (2) The Windows leg was leaking ~250 `test\*` entries into the cobertura because run_coverage.sh's `COVERAGE_IGNORE_REGEX` matches `/test/` only — backslash paths slipped past. The merge now normalises slashes AND mirrors the same exclude regex (`tools/scripts/merge_cobertura.py::_IGNORE_RE`) so the gate's view is consistent regardless of which OS produced an artifact. Keep the regex in lockstep with `scripts/run_coverage.sh::COVERAGE_IGNORE_REGEX`.
- **Install PyYAML before any step that imports it.** `tools/scripts/test_coverage_tier_check.py` calls `ctc.load_targets()` which imports `yaml`, so the `Install PyYAML` step in `coverage.yml` must run BEFORE both the fixture-tests step and the per-tier gate step. Issue #900 caught the original ordering where the install ran after the test, so runners without preinstalled PyYAML hard-failed the required coverage job. If you add another script under `tools/scripts/` that imports `yaml` and gets wired into a workflow, make sure the PyYAML install step precedes every step that runs it.
- **Every first-party source must classify into exactly one tier (#1056).** `ci/coverage-targets.yaml` tier globs are silent no-ops if a new source path falls outside every tier — it inherits the looser global 75% floor instead of its intended tier. The `TierCoverageCompleteness` cases in `tools/scripts/test_coverage_tier_check.py` lock this in (every tier matches at least one file; every first-party source under `core/`, `tools/`, `apple/`, `android/`, `inspect/` lands in exactly one tier). Non-instrumented surfaces (`apple/**.swift`, `android/**.kt`, `apple/Package.swift`) classify under `infrastructure` for audit-completeness; the `is_instrumented_source` filter in `coverage_tier_check.py` keeps them out of the score so they don't bias the per-tier number.
- **Don't `cancel-in-progress: true` the coverage workflow (#1884).** `coverage.yml` deliberately sets `concurrency.cancel-in-progress: false`. Codecov's `after_n_builds: 4` (pulp#1883) waits for all per-OS uploads before posting; if a force-push cancels an in-flight run mid-upload, some legs upload and others don't, Codecov gets stuck waiting for the missing leg, and the PR merges with no coverage signal. A 2026-05-12 audit found this pattern on 21/30 most-recent merged PRs (~70% of merges shipping without the `Diff coverage required` check). The fix costs some compute on stale commits but guarantees every push ends with a real check conclusion. If you ever need to flip cancellation back on for this workflow, you MUST also change the Codecov side (drop `after_n_builds` or accept partial reports) or you re-open the same silent-skip.

## IWYU advisory gate (`#594` Phase 2)

`.github/workflows/iwyu.yml` runs include-what-you-use on the Linux Clang lane to catch transitive-include bugs before they reach the cross-platform matrix. Three incidents on 2026-04-21 (#540 `<memory>`, Slice 4 `<atomic>`, #593 `<algorithm>`) triggered this gate.

- **Advisory until 2026-05-05** — `continue-on-error: true`. PR annotations appear inline on the diff; merges are not blocked.
- **Linux Clang only** — macOS libc++ hides the bug class (false negatives); MSVC is not Clang. Don't attempt to extend it to those runners.
- **Scope** — PR events analyze only files changed vs `origin/<base>`; push-to-main events run a full repo scan and upload the raw IWYU output as an artifact so we can track FP trends.
- **The parser is unit-tested.** When touching `tools/scripts/iwyu_annotate.py`, run `python3 tools/scripts/test_iwyu_annotate.py` locally — the workflow runs it as a pre-flight fixture check so regressions fail fast without burning the build.
- **Mappings** — `.iwyu-mappings.imp` at the repo root maps CHOC amalgamated headers and libstdc++ detail paths to the canonical public include. Prefer fixing the code (adding the missing include) over adding a new mapping.
- **Flip to blocking** (Phase 3 of #594) requires FP rate < 5% across a one-week window. On the flip PR, edit `continue-on-error` to `false`, update `docs/guides/iwyu.md`'s "Advisory until" line, and reference the flip in the PR body. Do not close #594 until the blocking gate has held for a week.

See [docs/guides/iwyu.md](../../../docs/guides/iwyu.md) for the full contributor-facing write-up.

## PEP 668 + Namespace runners

Namespace's runner image is PEP-668-strict: `pip install --user <pkg>` fails with `error: externally-managed-environment` unless you also pass `--break-system-packages`. The github-hosted ubuntu-latest image tolerates `--user` without the flag, so this regression only surfaces after a workflow's matrix routes its Linux leg through Namespace via a `PULP_*_RUNS_ON_JSON` repo variable.

When you add a new `pip install --user` step to a workflow that may run on Namespace, ALWAYS include `--break-system-packages`. Same applies to any virtualenv-less Python helper installed inline at workflow time. If the workflow uses a hard-coded `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04` (e.g. `coverage-diff-gate`), the flag isn't required because GH-hosted runners aren't PEP-668-strict — but adding the flag is harmless and future-proofs against a later Namespace migration.

Symptom (on Namespace) when you forget:

```
error: externally-managed-environment
× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install python3-xyz, ...
```

Followed by cascade-skipped downstream steps (default `if: success()`) and a "coverage.python.xml is missing" hard-fail in the validation step. Coverage Linux ran into this when it migrated to Namespace via `PULP_COVERAGE_LINUX_RUNS_ON_JSON` (PR #676 → #677).

## Homebrew on Namespace macOS runners (PR #2399)

Namespace macOS runners (`nscloud-macos-tahoe-arm64-*`) come up with
Homebrew configured to disable automatic updates AND with a stale
package index. Any first-call `brew install <pkg>` on a fresh runner
exits non-zero with:

```
You have disabled automatic updates and have not updated today.
Do not report this issue until you've run `brew update` and tried
again.
```

Fix: always run `brew update --quiet` before the first `brew install`
on macOS legs. The step is gated `if: runner.os == 'macOS'` so it
no-ops on Linux/Windows. Local self-hosted Macs already keep brew
warm between runs, so the update is a quick no-op there too —
unconditional execution is simpler than per-runner-environment
detection. See `.github/workflows/build.yml` for the canonical
placement (immediately before `Install ccache (macOS)`).

Cache: the `Namespace cache (brew + ccache + Pulp FetchContent)`
step uses `namespacelabs/nscloud-cache-action@v1` with `cache: brew`
plus ccache and FetchContent paths. It runs only on Namespace /
nscloud labels (`contains(matrix.runs_on_json, 'namespace') ||
contains(matrix.runs_on_json, 'nscloud')`); self-hosted Macs keep
their caches on local disk and github-hosted runners use
`actions/cache@v4` via the existing `Restore ccache (GitHub-hosted)`
step (#420). The brew cache only restores the bottle download cache —
it does NOT restore the brew config that would tell the runner
"updates are recent," so `brew update --quiet` is still required
even when the cache hits.

Incident: 2026-05-19 — PRs #2367, #2374, #2378, #2388 all wedged on
the macOS `Install ccache (macOS)` step within minutes of each other
because Namespace's runner image had drifted past the freshness
window the brew preamble enforces. Adding `brew update --quiet`
once unblocks the whole queue.

## SignalGraph Phase 0 learnings (PR #153)

Gotchas surfaced while landing the four-phase SignalGraph follow-up:

- **AudioUnitSDK 1.4 uses `std::expected` (C++23).** Targets that `#include`
  AUSDK headers need `set_target_properties(<target> PROPERTIES CXX_STANDARD 23)`
  at the per-target level. `target_compile_features(<target> PUBLIC cxx_std_23)`
  alone is **not** enough when `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20` is set at the repo
  root — CMake 3.24's policy makes CXX_STANDARD authoritative over feature
  requirements. Apply to both the `ausdk` target and every consumer
  (`pulp-format`, per-plugin `${target}_AU`). Symptom: GH-hosted mac fails
  with "no template named 'unexpected'"; local Xcode mac builds fine
  because Apple's libc++ is ahead. Linux/Windows are unaffected because
  they don't touch AUSDK.

- **`std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<T>>` needs C++20 libc++ which our
  toolchain doesn't ship.** The workaround is the deprecated
  `std::atomic_load_explicit(&shared_ptr_var, order)` /
  `std::atomic_store_explicit(&shared_ptr_var, value, order)`
  free-function overloads. These still work everywhere we build and
  preserve acquire/release semantics. Revisit when libc++ catches up.

- **Catch2 `REQUIRE` inside a `std::thread` body terminates the process.**
  The REQUIRE throws and std::thread's dtor calls std::terminate when
  unwinding across the thread boundary. For concurrency tests, use an
  `std::atomic<int>` failure counter from the worker and assert on the
  main thread after join.

- **GH-hosted macOS vs local mac for upstream SDK issues.** When an
  upstream SDK (AUSDK, VST3, …) breaks only on `macos-latest` while the
  exact same code builds on a developer's Xcode, that's an Apple clang
  version mismatch. Options: (a) pin the SDK to a known-good commit,
  (b) set CXX_STANDARD per target, (c) `gh pr merge --admin` if
  Linux+Windows Namespace are green and local mac validated. Don't
  chase GH-hosted mac issues on the PR branch — fix upstream or admin-merge.

- **FetchContent threejs clones hang on some macs.** The threejs git
  clone inside CMake's FetchContent step has hung indefinitely several
  times during fresh configures. Mitigations: reuse an existing
  configured build dir; `rm -rf build/_deps/threejs-*` then build only
  the targets that don't need it (e.g., `pulp-host`, `pulp-test-host`);
  or set `-DPULP_ENABLE_GPU=OFF` to bypass the threejs fetch entirely.

- **Fresh worktree cmake configure is expensive (~15+ min)** because every
  FetchContent dep re-populates. Reuse strategy: `git checkout -B
  feature/<new-phase> origin/main` on an already-configured worktree to
  inherit the populated `_deps/`. Saves ~70% on per-phase bootstrap.

- **Skill-sync + version-bump CI gates run on every push.** After each
  push that touches `tools/cli/`, `core/host/`, `.agents/skills/`,
  you'll likely need to (a) append a new bullet to `hosting/SKILL.md`
  or `cli-maintenance/SKILL.md`, and (b) run
  `python3 tools/scripts/version_bump_check.py --mode=apply` to update
  `CMakeLists.txt` + `CHANGELOG.md`. The gate reports "SDK X.Y.Z ✓
  bumped" when satisfied.
- **Android/Kotlin coverage lives in `android.yml`, not `coverage.yml`.**
  The dedicated `android-kotlin-coverage` job provisions Java + the
  Android SDK/NDK, runs `:app:testDebugUnitTest` plus
  `:app:jacocoDebugUnitTestReport`, uploads the JaCoCo artifacts, and
  sends the XML to Codecov. Keep it separate from the Clang-based
  `coverage.yml` matrix — Android coverage is a Gradle/SDK lane, not a
  native profraw lane.

- **Release-time workflows must declare `permissions: contents: write`.**
  Both `release-cli.yml` and `sign-and-release.yml` write to the
  GitHub Releases API (create the release, upload artifacts, fetch
  generate-release-notes content). Without an explicit job-level
  permissions block they inherit a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` on
  `push: tags` events and the `Create GitHub Release` step fails with
  `Resource not accessible by integration` — silent release failure
  that lost ~30 sign-and-release runs across v0.20.x → v0.41.0. See
  `ship` SKILL.md § "`sign-and-release.yml` must declare …" for the
  full gotcha; pulp #720 + #724 for the history. When adding a new
  release-time workflow, add the same block.

### Shipyard-drift detection — pre-push hook logs push origin (pulp #1406)

`.githooks/pre-push` writes every push to `.git/.shipyard-drift-log`
(tab-separated: timestamp, branch, sha, origin) so we can audit when
PRs went up via `shipyard pr` (the canonical full-validation path)
versus a direct `git push` (which silently bypasses skill-sync,
version-bump, diff-coverage, and SSH-host validation, turning CI
into the discovery channel).

**Origin signals** (any one marks the push as supervised):
- `SHIPYARD_PR_RUNNING=1` — set by shipyard's wrapper when it
  invokes git push internally. Upstream feature request open at
  the shipyard CLI repo to make this canonical.
- `PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1` — user-set fallback marker for supervised
  direct pushes (e.g. inside a `shipyard ship` retry, or when
  using `git push` deliberately under shipyard tooling that
  doesn't expose the env var yet).

**Behavior**:
- Push proceeds either way (escape hatches need to keep working).
- When neither var is set, hook prints a loud warning with the
  recovery checklist (rate-limit / shipyard-bug / SSH-down).
- The drift log is append-only and gitignored.

**When to suppress the warning** (acceptable temporary fallback):
1. GraphQL rate limit exhausted — verify with
   `gh api rate_limit --jq .resources.graphql.remaining` and
   note the reset time.
2. Shipyard tool itself fails — file an issue at the shipyard CLI
   repo, link it in the PR description.
3. SSH host unreachable — prefer `shipyard pr --skip-target NAME`
   (deliberate skip) over direct push.

In all three cases, set `PULP_VIA_SHIPYARD=1` on the direct-push
command to record the push as supervised AND suppress the warning.

After the obstacle clears, resume `shipyard pr` on the next PR.

### GraphQL exhaustion fallback

GitHub's GraphQL quota is independent from the REST `core` quota and is easier
to burn during broad PR sweeps because `gh pr list/view/merge --json ...`
queries large nested PR/check payloads. When GraphQL is exhausted, do not idle
and do not keep retrying GraphQL-backed commands in a loop.

Check quota explicitly:

```bash
gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources | {core, graphql}'
```

Fallback rules while `graphql.remaining == 0`:

- Use REST for status polling:
  `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR`,
  `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/commits/SHA/check-runs?per_page=100`, and
  `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/jobs/JOB_ID/logs`.
- Treat `gh pr view --json`, `gh pr list --json`, and `gh pr merge` as
  unavailable unless proven otherwise; those paths commonly fail before REST
  quota is close to exhausted.
- If a PR is verified green via REST (required checks green, no actionable
  failures in the checks being honored for that lane), merge via REST:

```bash
head_sha=$(gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR --jq '.head.sha')
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR/merge \
  -X PUT \
  -f sha="$head_sha" \
  -f merge_method=squash \
  -f commit_title='subject (#PR)'
```

If REST merge returns `405 Base branch was modified`, refresh the PR's REST
state and check runs, recompute `head_sha`, and retry once after the base
settles only if the refreshed head SHA and green status are still the values
you intend to merge. If checks have re-queued or the head SHA changed,
re-evaluate before merging. This fallback is for GitHub API transport
exhaustion only; it does not relax the requirement to fix real CI, coverage,
sanitizer, or review failures.

## Self-hosted runner ops

Pulp's required `macos` branch-protection check on `main` routes
through the local self-hosted `sanitizer` runner (via the
`PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON` repo variable, consumed by
`.github/workflows/build.yml` → `resolve-provider`). When that runner
wedges, every PR's `macos` check sits queued indefinitely and all PRs
land in `mergeable_state=blocked`.

Shipyard v0.55.0+ ships a complete operational toolkit for this
class of problem — **prevent → recover → keep current**. Pulp pins
Shipyard ≥ 0.56.2 in `tools/shipyard.toml` so recovery, update, and
`shipyard wait pr` all have REST fallback paths when GraphQL is rate-limited
or unavailable. The authoritative reference lives in Shipyard's
`skills/ci/SKILL.md`; this section is the Pulp-side quick reference +
Pulp-specific gotchas.

### Recover — `shipyard rescue <PR>` (v0.53.0+)

```bash
shipyard rescue <PR>                # cancel queued runs + redispatch
                                    # to github-hosted (default)
shipyard rescue <PR> --rerun-failed # also re-arm completed/cancelled
                                    # runs (watchdog-cancellation case)
shipyard rescue <PR> --dry-run      # preview without acting
shipyard rescue --all-stuck         # repo-wide sweep
shipyard rescue <PR> --to github-hosted   # explicit provider
```

One command replaces the legacy 5-step recipe (`runner-watchdog --fix`
→ `gh run rerun --failed` → `shipyard cloud handoff run --apply`
manual sweep). Safe under load — does not mark required checks as
`failure`. Cross-link: Shipyard `skills/ci/SKILL.md#rescuing-wedged-
runners-shipyard-rescue`.

After a rescue, prefer `shipyard wait pr <PR> --state green` over manual
polling. Shipyard v0.56.2 adds a REST fallback for this wait path; use
`--no-fallback` only when a caller must fail instead of polling.

### Prevent — `shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers` (v0.54.0+)

```bash
# One-time setup on a self-hosted runner host (Daniels-MacBook-Pro):
shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers
# Pair with launchd / systemd for unattended ops.
```

Host-side daemon that auto-cancels stale queued runs AND auto-kills
hung `Runner.Worker` processes (snapshot → SIGTERM → grace → SIGKILL
→ reap children → quarantine partial builds → verify Runner.Listener
→ optionally wait for GitHub status flip). Implies `--fix`. Emits
`runner.watch` JSON envelopes (`event=auto_kill_worker`,
`phase ∈ {attempt, killed, failed, no-pid-found}`) for telemetry.

Cross-link: Shipyard `skills/ci/SKILL.md#preventing-wedges-runner-
watch--kill-hung-workers`.

### Keep current — `shipyard update` (v0.55.0+)

```bash
shipyard update --check --json   # report installed vs available
shipyard update                  # apply latest stable
shipyard update --to v0.56.2     # pin / rollback to Pulp's minimum
shipyard update --dry-run        # plan only
```

Replaces the bootstrap-only `curl … install.sh | sh` workflow. Pulp's
CI / daily cron should run `shipyard update --check --json` to surface
drift; humans run `shipyard update` to apply.

### Pulp-specific gotchas (real wedge patterns)

- **iOS AUv3 try-compile hangs.** `test/cmake/test_ios_auv3_configure.sh`
  shells `xcodebuild CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE.xcodeproj build` which can
  deadlock on `simctl` / keychain / codesign on the self-hosted host
  (observed 2026-05-13). The `runner watch --kill-hung-workers` daemon
  detects the stall via `Runner.Worker` not making progress for >5 min
  and kills it cleanly.
- **Test binaries open real windows on the dev mac.** Several
  `pulp-test-*` binaries (auval validation, headless-view variants,
  iOS AUv3 try-compile, visual-harness tests) create macOS surfaces
  during CI. Because the runner runs as the human's user account,
  those windows pop on the dev mac's display. Either move the runner
  to a dedicated user account, or accept the brief popups.
- **PRs that touch CI/runner workflows need a manual handoff.** If the
  PR's macOS lane was cancelled by the wedge, even after `rescue` the
  PR may need a fresh push to retrigger the version-skill-sync check
  too.

### Anti-pattern (legacy)

- `planning/scripts/runner-watchdog.sh --fix` — superseded. Use
  `shipyard rescue` (recover, PR-side) or `shipyard runner watch
  --kill-hung-workers` (prevent, host-side).

### Composition with `Version-Bump` gate

`shipyard rescue` does not interact with the `Enforce version & skill
sync` check. If a PR title starts with `fix:` / `feat:` and the branch
lacks either a `chore: bump versions` commit OR a
`Version-Bump: skip reason="..."` trailer on the tip commit, the
version-skill-sync check fails independently. The trailer block must
be CONTIGUOUS (no blank line between `Version-Bump:` and any other
trailer like `Co-Authored-By:`) or git's `interpret-trailers` won't
recognize it. Verify with
`tools/scripts/version_bump_check.py --mode=report --base=origin/main
--require-bump-for-fix-feat --pr-title="..."` which prints
`bypass honored` when the trailer parses correctly.

### Manual machine-side recovery (true last resort)

If `shipyard rescue` doesn't help (e.g. the runner's host OS itself is
unresponsive, not just the Worker), the machine-side recovery is:

1. SSH the runner host (or open Terminal locally if it's the dev mac).
2. `ps -ef | grep '[R]unner.Worker'` — confirm orphan Worker PIDs.
3. `kill <pid>` (gentle), `kill -9` after 30 s grace.
4. Restart via `~/actions-runner/svc.sh restart` or `launchctl
   kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/actions.runner.<owner>-<repo>.<name>`.
5. After restart: `shipyard runner watch --kill-hung-workers` (one-time
   foreground) verifies the host is healthy before enabling the
   permanent daemon.

Agents should NOT do step 1–4 themselves; ask the human via
`PushNotification`. Agents CAN and SHOULD run `shipyard rescue` for
the PR-side recovery without waiting.

## Cobertura artifact verification (A2 first cut, 2026-05)

The "Cobertura is structurally non-empty" assertion (pulp #605 — a well-formed XML with `lines-valid="0"` gets rejected by Codecov v5 as "Unusable report") used to live as an inline `python3 -c '...'` heredoc in `coverage.yml`, duplicated for the native and Python lanes.

It now lives in `tools/scripts/verify_cobertura_xml.py`. Both lane verifications call:

```bash
python3 tools/scripts/verify_cobertura_xml.py "$xml" \
  --label "<lane>.xml" \
  --hint "<upstream-step-likely-broken>"
```

If you add a third Cobertura artifact (e.g. a future Kotlin lane), reuse the same script — do not paste a new heredoc. Tests in `tools/scripts/test_verify_cobertura_xml.py` cover missing file, empty file, unparseable XML, lines-valid=0 (with and without `--hint`), lines-valid>0, and label propagation. The pattern follows B1's `classify-subject` extraction — script over inline-Python, single source of truth.

## Format validator baseline diff gate

`.github/workflows/format-baseline-diff.yml` runs the format-validator baseline diff (`tools/scripts/format_baseline_diff.py`) whenever a PR touches `core/format/**`, `core/host/src/plugin_slot_*`, `core/host/include/pulp/host/plugin_slot.hpp`, the baseline fixtures, or the scripts themselves.

Behavior:

- Builds `PulpEffect` (AU + VST3 + CLAP) in Release on the self-hosted macOS lane.
- Installs the three bundles into `~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/{Components,VST3,CLAP}/`.
- Captures normalized output from `auval`, `pluginval`, `clap-validator`.
- Diffs against committed fixtures in `test/fixtures/format-baseline/`.

Re-capture procedure (when a diff is intentional):

```bash
tools/scripts/format_baseline_capture.sh --build --plugin PulpEffect
```

Commit the updated `test/fixtures/format-baseline/*.txt` files in the same PR. No exception path — intentional behavior changes update the baseline; unintentional regressions get fixed at the source.

## Source-tree pollution: root-allowlist mode

`tools/scripts/source_tree_pollution_check.py` now has a fourth mode beyond `stage` / `push` / `files`: **`--mode=root-allowlist`**.

The root-allowlist mode reads `git ls-tree --name-only <rev>` and fails if any top-level entry is not in `ALLOWED_ROOT_PATHS` (a frozenset declared at the top of the script — ~51 entries covering hidden config, root docs, root build/config files, and subsystem directories).

Wiring:

- `.githooks/pre-push` invokes `--mode=root-allowlist --rev HEAD` right after the existing `--mode=push` check. Hard-fail; no env-var bypass.
- `.github/workflows/source-tree-pollution-check.yml` runs the same mode in CI. Triggers on `paths: ['**']` (the check is ~5s — no point gating). Catches direct REST / admin merges that skip the pre-push hook.

Adding a new top-level entry requires the same-PR allowlist update — the gate's error message points contributors to the exact line in the script. See the new "Repo-root hygiene" section in `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contributor-facing explanation.

## Namespace macOS overflow on `workflow_dispatch`

`resolve-provider` in `.github/workflows/build.yml` applies the Namespace macOS overflow logic on both `pull_request` AND `workflow_dispatch` events (since 2026-05-19, closes #2314).

Pre-2026-05-19 behavior gated overflow on `EVENT_NAME == "pull_request"` only, which silently routed `shipyard pr` ship cycles (`workflow_dispatch`-triggered) back to the local self-hosted Mac. That defeated the 2026-05-18 cloud cutover for the path most contributors hit.

Precedence on `workflow_dispatch`:
1. `inputs.macos_runner_selector_json` (operator override) — always wins.
2. Namespace overflow when local Mac BUSY ≥ threshold.
3. Local default (`PULP_LOCAL_MACOS_RUNS_ON_JSON`).

Manual `workflow_dispatch` with an explicit selector input still overrides; the fix only changes behavior for dispatches that arrive without one (which is the `shipyard pr` shape).

## Change classifier — skip the native build for non-code PRs

`build.yml` has a `classify` job (ubuntu, ~10 s) that runs
`tools/scripts/classify_changes.py` to decide `native_build_required`.
When a PR touches no C++/Swift build input (docs, `*.md`, `.githooks/`,
`.shipyard/`, etc.), the `build` matrix and `windows-msvc-release-gate`
are skipped at the job level — no runner is allocated, no Skia/Dawn
compile — and the `macos`/`linux`/`windows` alias jobs report a fast
green from Ubuntu.

Key facts:

- `classify_changes.py` is **fail-closed**: any uncertainty, git error,
  or empty diff -> `native_build_required=true` (run the build).
  Skipping is the optimization; running is the safe default.
- The skip-safe set is a deliberately small allowlist (`*.md` anywhere,
  `docs/`, `planning/`, `.githooks/`, `.shipyard/`, `.shipyard.local/`,
  a few exact files). Everything else — including `core/**`, all
  `CMakeLists.txt`, `tools/cmake/**`, `tools/scripts/**`,
  `.github/workflows/**`, and the classifier itself — forces the
  native build.
- **Deny-list exception: `docs/migrations/*.md` forces the build.**
  Those `.md` files are globbed with `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` into the
  generated `migration_index.cpp` by `tools/cli/CMakeLists.txt`, so
  `FORCE_BUILD_PREFIXES` overrides the `.md`/`docs/` skip-safe rules.
  Any future doc path that feeds codegen must be added there too.
- Diffs are collected with `git diff --no-renames` so a code→docs
  rename can't hide the old code path and wrongly classify skip-safe.
- The required `macos` check is now produced by a dedicated `macos`
  alias job (`if: always()`), NOT by the build matrix leg. The matrix
  leg is named `macOS (ARM64) [<provider>]` uniformly with linux/windows.
- The alias jobs are **fail-closed on a `classify`-job failure**: if
  `needs.classify.result != 'success'` the `macos` gate fails RED
  rather than trusting an unwritten/empty `native_build_required`.
- To change what counts as skip-safe: edit `SKIP_SAFE_PREFIXES` /
  `SKIP_SAFE_EXACT` / `FORCE_BUILD_PREFIXES` in `classify_changes.py`
  and add a case to `test_classify_changes.py`. Never widen the
  allowlist without a test.
