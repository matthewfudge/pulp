# Phase 3 Codecov Queue Pause Ledger

Last updated: 2026-05-05 10:54 PDT

This local ledger records the open `codecov` PR validation runs paused to free Namespace capacity for higher-priority work, plus the small-batch resume queue. Branches, PRs, commits, labels, and tracker comments stay intact; queued GitHub Actions validation attempts are cancellable and replaceable.

## Queue Policy

- Reopen Codecov validation in small batches; do not dump the full paused queue back into Namespace at once.
- While a batch is in flight, continue local-only tranche preparation, review, and failure triage.
- Merge `UNSTABLE` PRs only when GitHub branch protection shows all required checks are green and the PR can merge normally.
- For merge eligibility after a pause, refresh PR branches with `gh pr update-branch <pr>` so GitHub creates fresh `pull_request` check suites.
- Use `shipyard cloud run build <branch> --provider namespace --require-sha <sha> --no-wait` only as a Namespace smoke or targeted diagnostic; successful `workflow_dispatch` checks do not replace stale failed or cancelled `pull_request` contexts for branch protection.
- If one lane is slow or stuck, prefer `shipyard cloud retarget`/`shipyard cloud add-lane` so existing useful runs are preserved instead of cancelled wholesale.
- Branch protection currently requires the lower-case `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` contexts. The visible Namespace child jobs may appear as
  `Linux (x64) [namespace]`, `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`, and
  `Windows (x64) [namespace]`; wait for the lower-case reusable-workflow
  wrappers to settle before declaring a PR mergeable.

## Snapshot Summary

- Open `codecov` PRs in snapshot: 73
- Queued/in-progress Codecov-branch workflow runs selected for cancellation: 193
- Selected workflows: Build and Test, Coverage, Sanitizer Tests

## Pause Update 2026-05-04

Latest read-only REST snapshot at 2026-05-04 16:09 PDT shows 18 open
`codecov` PRs: #1256, #1257, #1263, #1266, #1269, #1271, #1273,
#1274, #1275, #1276, #1278, #1279, #1280, #1282, #1283, #1285,
#1286, and #1287.

No CI dispatch, PR branch update, rerun, push, or merge was performed
while Namespace capacity is reserved for other projects. Keep the
Phase 3 queue paused and continue only local validation / ledger
reconciliation until capacity returns.

key-up/unhandled-key, modifier/word and shift navigation, delete/redo,
shift-click, and exact double-click word-selection paths for the #493
view tranche on current `origin/main` `cf5ea658`. A first local refresh

`0447498e` already covers the same PopupMenu item metadata and non-Apple
stub no-selection paths in `test/test_file_dialog.cpp`. Treat #1276 as
low-value duplicate coverage during the pause. Resume note: when
Namespace capacity returns, either close/supersede #1276 after a final
Codecov/code check, or retarget it to a platform gap that is not already
covered by `origin/main`.

The earlier #1272 Android failure remains classified as external
infrastructure: Gradle could not resolve `dl.google.com` while
installing Build-Tools 34. The PR later merged as
`cb641ff19c16ce0115e3dae7c04e5c2fa5a62760`; if the same failure
reappears on another Android coverage tranche, treat it as rerun-only,
not a code patch, once the workflow is in a safe rerunnable state.

  Applied `codecov`, linked #641/#643, and PR-event checks are

  `run_python_coverage.py --pattern tools/scripts/test_cmajor_external.py
  --pattern tools/scripts/test_cmajor_external_extra.py`, the Cmajor doctor
  smoke, and diff cleanliness checks; focused coverage reported 100% for

  the full head SHA after an earlier comment expanded the short SHA
  incorrectly.

  Applied `codecov`, linked #641/#643, then force-pushed a correction so
  the extra tests live under the default Linux Python coverage surface at

  limited to `test/test_phase9_widgets.cpp`. Merged from `UNSTABLE` as
  `ef4303856482580beb5dcc4c15a7f22a2715454a` after required wrappers and
  Codecov patch were green; only advisory/non-blocking checks were active.

  `feature/phase3-websocket-channel-edges-641`, head `80dd3df80eda`.
  Applied `codecov`, linked #641, and PR-event checks are queued/running.
  The branch was rebased after #1236 merged; local validation included
  `pulp-test-websocket-channel`, 11 matching WebSocket CTest cases, direct
  binary run with 62 assertions in 11 test cases, and diff checks.
- Refill: opened #1240 from

  `feature/phase3-docs-generate-coverage-643`, head `7d9b34c6a985`.
  Applied `codecov`, linked #641/#643, and PR-event checks are
  queued/running. Local validation after rebasing onto `origin/main` at
  `f6e092ba6475` included 15 docs-generator tests,
  `tools/docs_generate.py check`, focused 100% coverage for
  `tools/docs_generate.py`, and diff checks.
- GitHub Actions pressure: #1231, #1239, #1240, and #1241 have PR-event
  Build/Coverage checks active or queued on Namespace-backed lanes and no
  failed checks. The newer batch is draining normally.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-check-docs-status-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `36e80fe7` against `origin/main` at `ef430385`; 10
  format-validation tests, 23 coverage-runner tests, warn-mode format
  validation, focused coverage, and diff checks passed. Warn mode still
  reports 4 existing missing `production_validated` entries.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-websocket-channel-edges-641`
  refreshed cleanly at `7b86ded8` with direct WebSocket tests, 11 matching
  CTest cases, and a narrowed coverage/diff-cover mirror green. A follow-up
  worker reconfirmed the branch is still based on `origin/main` at
  `8a9eadc47004`, clean, one commit ahead, and limited to
  `test/test_websocket_channel.cpp`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-eq-curve-view-edges-493` refreshed
  cleanly at `e1367951` with direct `[eq_curve]` widget tests, 4 matching
  CTest cases, and diff scope limited to `test/test_phase9_widgets.cpp`.
- Refill progress: `pulp-phase3-theme-io-validation-493` is now queued as
  #1240 at `af241124` with direct `[theme]` tests, 17 matching CTest cases,
  and diff scope limited to `test/test_theme.cpp`.
- Local-only audit: `pulp-phase3-canvas-fallback-edges-641` was rebased to
  `origin/main` at `69bbe8a4`; the old local patch was already absorbed
  upstream as `42464b4b` / #1201, so no reopen action is needed. Validation
  still passed: `pulp-test-canvas "[canvas][fallback]"` reported 62
  assertions in 4 test cases.
- Local-only audit: `pulp-phase3-rectangle-list-edges-641` was rebased to
  `origin/main` at `f6e092ba`; the old local patch was already absorbed
  upstream as `9d1e7d66` / #1203. Validation still passed:
  `pulp-test-rectangle-list` reported 60 assertions in 16 test cases and
  matching CTest passed 16/16.
- Refill progress: `pulp-docs-generate-coverage-643` is now queued as #1241
  at `7d9b34c6` with 15 docs-generator tests, `tools/docs_generate.py check`,
  focused 100% coverage for `tools/docs_generate.py`, and diff checks green.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-mkdocs-hooks-coverage-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `900faf7b` against `origin/main` at `ef430385`; direct hook unittest
  passed 10 tests and diff checks are clean. Local coverage/pytest variants
  are blocked only because this machine lacks `coverage.py >= 7.10` and
  `pytest`; earlier focused coverage for this tranche reported 100% for
  `tools/mkdocs_hooks.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-merge-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `29cb5a51` with 17 total tests and 100% target coverage for
  `tools/scripts/merge_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-lcov-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `e931e469` with 19 total tests and 100% target coverage for
  `tools/scripts/lcov_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-app-framework-edges-493` was rebased
  cleanly again to `f5a44955` after #1237 merged. The earlier target
  validation remains recorded below, but this latest head was not
  revalidated because both `build/` and `build-cov/` had been removed from
  the worktree; rerun the focused app-framework build before queueing.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-phase3-asset-manager-coverage-493` remains
  useful after #1125 and refreshed cleanly at `9bd0fea1` against
  `origin/main` at `f6e092ba`. It adds file-backed shader/blob cache and
  cached `@2x` image behavior coverage; `pulp-test-asset-manager` passed 75
  assertions in 29 test cases, matching CTest passed 24/24, and diff checks
  are clean.
- Local-only audit: `pulp-phase3-table-model-edges-493` rebased to
  `origin/main` with no remaining diff; the tranche is already absorbed
  upstream via earlier table-model work and should not be queued again.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-audit-top-level-coverage-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `339b79c8` with 9 tests and 100% target coverage for
  `tools/audit.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-resolve-runs-on-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `42f24313` with 18 base tests plus 2 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/resolve_runs_on.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-lcov-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `6ec8d60e` with 8 base tests plus 11 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/lcov_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-merge-cobertura-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `f40c0485` with 14 base tests plus 3 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/merge_cobertura.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-cmajor-external-extra-643` refreshed cleanly
  at `89f10266` with 4 base tests plus 9 extra tests and 100% target
  coverage for `tools/scripts/cmajor_external.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-skill-sync-extra-643` refreshed cleanly at
  `0631b22d` with 4 base tests plus 20 extra tests, 39 gate tests, and
  100% target coverage for `tools/scripts/skill_sync_check.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-freshness-extra-643` refreshed cleanly at
  `1f0507eb` with 9 extra tests, 23 combined package validation tests,
  and 100% target coverage for `tools/packages/freshness_check.py` when
  run with direct focused coverage over the package tests.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-validate-registry-extra-643` refreshed
  cleanly at `619560ed` with 8 extra tests, non-strict registry
  validation, and 100% target coverage for `tools/packages/validate_registry.py`.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-coverage-tier-check-extra-643` is now
  absorbed upstream; rebase skipped the old local commit and left no diff,
  so do not reopen it.
- Local-only progress: `pulp-ruleset-drift-config-643` refreshed again on
  2026-05-05 at `145cd195`; it remains a static guard/test-file-only
  tranche with no measured source surface in the focused Python coverage
  runner.
- Codecov dashboard watch: recent rapid main merges cancelled most older
  main-branch `Coverage` push runs. The main coverage run for #1213
  completed successfully at `ea03a328ef33`; #1214's merge should start
  the next main coverage push run for `e1ef40807145`.
- Just merged: #1117, #1204, #1199, #1194, #1125, #1116, #1113, #1104,
  #1097, #1088, #1203, #1115, #1195, #1083, #1096, #1200, #1205, #1078,
  #1196, #1197, #1198, #1202, and #1201 after required
  `linux`/`macos`/`windows` wrappers and Codecov patch gates were green.
- Active triage: none for #1202; it merged after the fake `amixer` PATH
  fix `b9e086fa` cleared the Namespace lanes. Refill from the local-ready
  queue while main post-merge jobs run.
- Retarget investigation: `shipyard cloud retarget` can plan a
  Namespace/GitHub-hosted lane move, but `--apply` failed while trying
  to cancel the old job. `gh` already has `workflow` scope and Shipyard
  doctor reports cloud auth ready; the job-level cancel endpoint returned
  GitHub 404. A fallback `workflow_dispatch` did not replace the stale
  queued PR-event check in the PR rollup for #1078. Filed Shipyard #265
  to make this recovery path explicit.
- Queue cleanup: cancelled duplicate active/queued `workflow_dispatch`
  build runs `25222305579`, `25216296162`, `25216004212`, and
  `25215881987` because they do not satisfy the current PR-event branch
  protection contexts and were consuming runner capacity.
- Refill: opened #1205 from `local/phase3-bench-diff-coverage-643`,

- Operating mode: keep polling, merge PRs as soon as required
  `linux`/`macos`/`windows` wrappers are green, cancel leftover advisory
  PR-head runs after merge, and only refill when the active queue drains
  or a high-confidence local tranche is already validated.

## Cancellation Result

- Cancellation pass completed on 2026-04-30 EDT.
- Cancellation requests submitted successfully for all 193 recorded runs.
- A few runs completed while cancellation was in flight; sticky queued
  runs for #1133 and #1134 required a second cancellation request.
- Final verification after GitHub settled: 0 queued or in-progress
  workflow runs remained for the open `codecov` PR branches in this
  snapshot.
- Expected side effect: cancelled validation attempts may leave PRs
  `BLOCKED` or `UNSTABLE` until the queue is reopened and fresh
  validation runs are dispatched.

## Resume Batches

### 2026-05-01 Batch 1: Build Gate Refill

Namespace capacity check showed no queued or in-progress GitHub workflow
runs for `danielraffel/pulp`, so the first refill batch replaced only the
cancelled `Build and Test` gates for recent Codecov PRs. Existing passing
Codecov/version/docs/license results were left intact.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `bf87273e0534` | Build and Test | `25202620106` | in progress |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `2d2c119b4c8d` | Build and Test | `25202620128` | in progress |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `cb6fb9c4e9c3` | Build and Test | `25202620088` | in progress |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `2b2ccde36e63` | Build and Test | `25202620280` | in progress |

Next refill rule: when this batch drops below four active Codecov build
runs, dispatch the next merge-ready paused PRs by pinned SHA and update
this table before adding more local-only tranche PRs.

Follow-up correction: these `workflow_dispatch` runs all passed, but they
did not satisfy branch protection because stale failed or cancelled
`pull_request` check runs with the same required context names remained on
the PR head commits. The branches were then refreshed against `main` with
`gh pr update-branch` to create merge-eligible PR-event check suites:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `f48a49e62ec3` | `25203370720` | `25203370713` | pending |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `bccfec4797d5` | `25203371862` | `25203371864` | pending |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `45dbdda453a3` | `25203373031` | `25203372990` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 2: Build Gate Refill

The first batch assigned cleanly on Namespace with no GitHub queued-run
backlog, so a second four-PR batch was queued behind it. This keeps the
active window warm without re-dispatching the full paused set.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `46854e04fcf2` | Build and Test | `25202718222` | queued |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `5149c107a3ac` | Build and Test | `25202718230` | queued |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `6fea2fa4686a` | Build and Test | `25202718329` | queued |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `a6237254b05d` | Build and Test | `25202718395` | queued |

Note: `shipyard cloud run build` printed older saved run IDs for #1136
and #1137, but `gh run list` confirmed the fresh workflow_dispatch run
IDs above.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 3: Build Gate Refill

A third build-only batch was queued after #1136-#1139. #1131 was not
queued because its `Diff coverage required` check is red and needs
coverage-gate triage before a build-only re-run can make it mergeable.

| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `2695097458c4` | Build and Test | `25202770455` | queued |

| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `89242ca0bfa5` | Build and Test | `25202770726` | queued |

Held for triage: #1131 `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next`
has passing `codecov/patch` but failing `Diff coverage required`, so it
likely needs a coverage workflow re-run or a patch rather than build-only
refill.

Follow-up correction: because build-only dispatches do not clear stale
PR-event contexts, the queued or running build-only dispatches for
#1132-#1139 were cancelled after the #1140-#1143 branch-refresh batch
started. Cancelled workflow_dispatch run IDs: `25202718222`,
`25202718230`, `25202718329`, `25202718395`, `25202770455`,
`25202770462`, `25202770509`, and `25202770726`.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 4: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After confirming the build-only dispatches were not merge-eligible
evidence, the next refill batch used `gh pr update-branch` so GitHub
created fresh required `pull_request` checks.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |

| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `bc32ea5904b6` | `25203513486` | `25203513496` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 5: PR-Event Branch Refresh

Namespace still had the earlier PR-event batch queued but not failing, so
the next low-risk stale build-matrix PRs were refreshed in a small batch.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1129 | `feature/midi-sysex-accumulator-coverage-645-next` | `a5ae96aa067c` | `25203575118` | `25203575127` | pending |

Follow-up refresh after `main` advanced through #1141 and #1131:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `539bbb76c41a` | `25204395492` | `25204395482` | pending; fresh PR-event checks queued with sanitizer run `25204395501` and IWYU run `25204395484` |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 6: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After #1139 merged and GitHub Actions pressure dropped to 18 active
runs, the next four patched/stale Codecov PRs were refreshed with
`gh pr update-branch` so branch protection gets fresh `pull_request`
contexts. Pressure after dispatch rose to 39 active runs, with 24 queued
and 13 in progress, so hold further refill until this batch drains.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 7: One-PR Refill

After stale duplicate workflow-dispatch and already-merged PR runs were
cancelled, only current PR-event work plus main advisory push workflows
remained in the queue. A single stale PR was refreshed to avoid flooding
Namespace while #1190, #1191, and #1188 continue draining.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 8: One-PR Refill

#1127 had no active runs and only stale cancelled/failed contexts from an
older base, so it was refreshed with `gh pr update-branch`. Hold further
cloud refill while #1127, #1128, #1191, and #1188 drain.

## Merge Waves While Queue Is In Flight

These PRs were already green/mergeable when the paused queue was
reopened, so they were squash-merged without consuming additional
Namespace capacity. #1099 became conflicted after the preceding view
coverage merges and is held for a branch refresh.

## Conflict And Failure Triage

| PR | Branch | New Head | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1099 | `feature/view-layout-widgets-coverage-493` | `66decf5958e8` | Merged as `a18291ee6642` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers passed; advisory lanes were still pending. |
| #1084 | `feature/runtime-text-diff-coverage-641` | `cb63e51416ed` | Merged as `66c74123430a` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers passed; advisory macOS sanitizer lanes were still pending. |
| #1089 | `feature/view-file-browser-coverage-493` | `86cbe4ca12e9` | Conflict resolved, pushed, and later merged as `d214d24ec20b` after required `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers, Namespace platform checks, Codecov patch, diff coverage, coverage lanes, and sanitizer lanes were green. |
| #1131 | `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next` | `f5af90f4f5af` | Pushed coverage-harness fix for Windows `.exe` object discovery in `scripts/run_coverage.sh`; `bash -n`, `test_run_coverage.py`, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check` passed. Local CMake validation was not rerun after the harness patch because the laptop filesystem had only about 150-211 MiB free; the earlier excerpt binary validation was already green and the platform-sensitive coverage fix now needs CI/Namespace. |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `e4ea28dfc2e0` | Pushed a test isolation fix after macOS Namespace exposed a parallel CTest temp-dir collision in `test_cli_projects_registry.cpp`. Focused local `pulp-test-cli-projects-registry "add_project falls back to directory basename when no name hint"` passed; skill-sync/version-bump reports and `git diff --check` passed. Merged as `ea731cbf365c` after required wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff coverage passed; advisory macOS sanitizer lanes were still pending. |
| #1079 | `feature/volume-detector-coverage-642` | `5efc687e53a0` | Conflict resolved after #1045 landed overlapping service-discovery coverage. Kept the non-duplicated lifecycle coverage from #1079, dropped the now-duplicated backend registration failure test, validated `pulp-test-network-service-discovery`, focused `[issue-642]`, broad `NSD|MountedVolumeListChangeDetector|LockingAsyncUpdater` CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then force-with-lease pushed. Merged as `da004f90e21c` after required wrappers, Namespace platform checks, Codecov patch, diff coverage, and coverage lanes were green. |
| #1202 | `feature/system-volume-coverage-640` | `b9e086fa7dfb` | Linux Namespace exposed that the fake `amixer` PATH hid normal shell tools used by the production pipeline. Patched the test to prepend the fake bin directory, not replace `PATH`; local `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-system-volume -j4`, direct test binary, focused CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check` passed. #1202 merged as `00b0871a6dea89fecb14d4aca8502e5c52507416`. |
| Shipyard #265 | `shipyard cloud retarget` | n/a | Filed `cloud retarget: support useful fallback when job cancellation is denied` after #1078 showed that retarget could identify the queued macOS lane, but apply failed while calling the job-level cancel endpoint. Follow-up evidence showed `gh` already has `workflow` scope and the endpoint returns GitHub 404, so the issue is likely unsupported job-level cancellation rather than only token scope. A plain GitHub-hosted `workflow_dispatch` started a new run but did not replace the stale queued PR-event check in the PR rollup. |

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 02:12 EDT

- Merge-now set: none.
- Watch first: #1123, #1099, #1132, #1142, #1143. These are mergeable at
  the Git level, have no real failing checks, and are waiting on the
  underlying Namespace/build or coverage legs before the lower-case
  required aliases can go green.
- #1075 was the only fresh actionable gate failure in this sweep
  (`Enforce version & skill sync` after the coverage workflow patch);
  it was fixed with metadata-only head `4469868e669b`.
- Older PRs with red lower-case `linux`/`macos`/`windows` contexts mostly
  reflect the deliberate queue-cancellation pause and need future
  PR-event branch refreshes in small batches, not immediate code patches.
- Queue pressure at the audit: roughly 72 active Codecov-like workflow
  runs across 25 branches, so do not refill Namespace until the current
  batch drains.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 02:55 EDT

- Open `codecov` PRs: 44.
- Merge-now set: none. All open Codecov PRs currently report
  `mergeStateStatus=BLOCKED`.
- GitHub Actions pressure: 60 queued workflow runs and 4 in progress for
  `danielraffel/pulp`, so do not add another PR-event refresh batch yet.
- Watch first: #1143, #1142, #1139, #1137, #1140. #1143 has Linux,
  Windows, diff coverage, Codecov patch, and advisory coverage/sanitizer
  lanes green, but its required `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]` build wrapper
  is still queued. #1142 is similarly waiting on macOS build and macOS
  coverage. #1139/#1137 are still waiting on macOS Namespace lanes, with
  #1137 also waiting on the Linux build wrapper.
- Local-only progress continues while the queue drains. Workers were
  assigned to refresh `local/phase3-merge-cobertura-extra-643`,
  `local/phase3-lcov-cobertura-extra-643`, and
  `local/phase3-run-python-coverage-extra-643` against current
  `origin/main`; no push, PR, or Namespace dispatch until capacity returns.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 03:17 EDT

- Open `codecov` PRs: 43 after #1120 merged.
- Merge-now set: none. A fresh merge-candidate query returned no
  `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` open Codecov PRs.
- GitHub Actions pressure remained high at 58 queued and 5 in progress,
  so no additional PR-event refresh batch was added.
- #1143 remained blocked only on the queued `macOS (ARM64) [namespace]`
  build job. A dry-run `shipyard cloud retarget --pr 1143 --target macOS
  --provider github-hosted --workflow build` showed a clean single-job
  retarget plan, but `--apply` could not cancel the queued job because
  the current `gh` token lacks `actions:write`. Leave the existing
  Namespace lane intact unless a human cancels it manually.

### Live Queue Audit 2026-05-01 03:33 EDT

- #1138 merged as `44cff0532848`; tracker comments posted to #641 and
  #493.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 40 after #1138 merged.
- Merge-now set: none. A fresh merge-candidate query returned no
  `CLEAN`/`UNSTABLE` open Codecov PRs.
- GitHub Actions pressure after the small refill batch: 50 active
  Codecov-like workflow runs, with 45 queued and 5 in progress.
- Watch first: #1143 and #1142 are still blocked on old queued macOS
  Namespace jobs. Keep those existing useful runs rather than pushing
  branch-refresh noise that would invalidate already-green lanes.
- Refill batch added because pressure had dropped below the earlier
  58-72 queued range:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Sanitizer Run | IWYU Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1045 | `feature/events-service-discovery-coverage-642-next6` | `bfc1d7f981c6` | `25206704717` | `25206704705` | `25206704724` | `25206704727` | queued/in progress |

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 03:38 EDT

- #1082 merged as `b0903cd8ed4b` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and the relevant platform build
  lanes were green. Advisory macOS sanitizer/coverage jobs were still
  queued at merge time.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #646.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 39 immediately after the merge; fresh
  merge-candidate poll returned none.
- Subsequent queue poll: 57 active Codecov-like workflow runs, with 51
  queued and 6 in progress. Do not add another Namespace/PR-event refill
  batch yet; continue local-only prep and merge monitoring.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 03:56 EDT

- #1135 merged as `44e67d52cbfc` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff coverage were green.
  Advisory macOS sanitizer jobs were still queued at merge time.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #645.
- Open `codecov` PRs: 38 immediately after the merge.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 04:08 EDT

- #1139 merged as `d701d4ae8d45` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Namespace build lanes, and Codecov patch were
  green. Pending macOS coverage and sanitizer jobs were advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #642.
- Queue pressure immediately before the merge was 18 active GitHub
  workflow runs, with 17 queued and 1 in progress, so capacity is low
  enough for another small refill batch rather than a full queue dump.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 04:30 EDT

- #1134 merged as `a01ca7410faa` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, coverage lanes,
  and sanitizer lanes were green.
- #1119 merged as `0bf8f64aeb8b` after required `linux`, `macos`,
  and `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. Pending macOS
  coverage was advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 for both merges and to #645 for #1134.

### Merge And Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:12 EDT

- #1137 merged as `ea731cbf365c` from `UNSTABLE` after required
  `linux`, `macos`, and `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, and diff
  coverage were green. Pending macOS ASan/UBSan jobs were advisory.
  Tracker comments were posted to #641 and #640.
- #1184 opened from the previously local memory-message-channel tranche
  as `feature/memory-message-channel-coverage-641` at
  `065ef90edbd3`. It was labeled `codecov`; PR-event checks are queued
  and explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209211899` was started with
  `shipyard cloud run build feature/memory-message-channel-coverage-641
  --provider namespace --require-sha HEAD --no-wait`.
- #1185 opened from the previously local binding tranche as
  `feature/state-binding-coverage-641` at `c1e5bd595244`. It was
  rebased onto `origin/main`, revalidated locally with
  `pulp-test-binding`, focused `Binding` CTest, skill-sync report,
  version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled `codecov`.
  Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209337122` is queued/running.
- The first #1184 `shipyard pr` attempt used the unskipped local target
  config and stopped before PR creation when SSH Windows timed out. The
  retry used the documented Namespace-first pattern:
  `shipyard pr --skip-target mac --skip-target ubuntu --skip-target
  windows`, followed by the explicit Namespace dispatch above.

### Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:21 EDT

- #1186 opened from the text-layout worker tranche as
  `feature/canvas-text-layout-coverage-641` at `d4d40aa77928`. It was
  rechecked locally with `pulp-test-text-shaper`, focused text-shaper
  CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`,
  then labeled `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch
  `25209419094` is queued/running.
- #1187 opened from the SVG worker tranche as
  `feature/canvas-svg-coverage-641` at `7e4e8c5fabdd`. It was rechecked
  locally with `pulp-test-svg`, exact `^SvgImage ` CTest, skill-sync
  report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled
  `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209443645` is
  queued/running.
- AssetManager worker output is held local-only because #1125 is already
  open on `feature/view-asset-manager-coverage-493-next` for the same
  surface.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:23 EDT

- #1143 merged as `d36fddc2cd9f` after required `linux`, `macos`, and

  build/coverage lanes were green. Pending macOS UBSan was advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #646.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:27 EDT

- #1075 merged as `c34f11f7138c` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. The red Windows
  coverage job was advisory artifact-upload plumbing: coverage suite,
  Cobertura existence check, and Codecov upload succeeded; only the
  Cobertura artifact upload step failed.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #643.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:33 EDT

- #1133 merged as `e1a22a1ffd93` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, and coverage/build
  lanes were green. Pending macOS ASan/UBSan jobs were advisory.

  Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25209808806` is queued/running.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #493.

### Refill Update 2026-05-01 05:48 EDT

- #1189 opened from the fast-math tranche as
  `feature/signal-fast-math-boundary-coverage-645` at `55a7e26b9415`.
  It was rebased/current with `origin/main`, revalidated locally with

  version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled `codecov`.
  Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25210105555` is queued/running.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #645.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 05:55 EDT

- #1086 merged as `0300ba207577` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers plus Codecov patch were green. Windows/Linux
  coverage and platform build lanes were green; pending macOS coverage
  and macOS sanitizer jobs were advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #640.
- Generated `build*` directories were removed from completed sibling
  coverage worktrees only, recovering local free disk from roughly
  248 MiB to roughly 3.7 GiB. Source worktrees and branches were left
  intact.

### Merge Update 2026-05-01 06:01 EDT

- #1074 merged as `5898bf057163` after required `linux`, `macos`, and
  `windows` wrappers, Codecov patch, diff coverage, coverage lanes, and
  platform build lanes were green. Pending macOS sanitizer jobs were
  advisory.
- Tracker comments posted to #641 and #640.

### Refill Update 2026-05-01 06:10 EDT

- #1190 opened from the path-to-SDF tranche as
  `feature/path-to-sdf-coverage-641` at `c4b62563589a`. It was already
  refreshed against current `origin/main`, revalidated locally with
  `pulp-test-path-to-sdf`, focused `path_to_sdf` CTest, skill-sync
  report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`, then labeled
  `codecov`. Explicit Namespace build dispatch `25210687152` is
  queued/running.
- Follow-up: the first Windows Namespace run exposed a pre-existing
  `pulp-test-hot-reload` watcher timing issue under parallel CTest, so
  #1190 was rebased onto `origin/main` at `7b78de80` and pushed at
  `69aa03601cb8` with deterministic hot-reload temp paths/content waits
  plus a CTest resource lock. Local validation passed
  `cmake --build build --target pulp-test-hot-reload -j4`,
  `./build/test/pulp-test-hot-reload "[view][hotreload]"`, focused
  `HotReloader` CTest, `pulp-test-path-to-sdf`, focused `path_to_sdf`
  CTest, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check`.
  Fresh PR-event checks are queued under Build and Test run
  `25211537622`.
- Tracker comment posted to #641.

## Real Diff-Gap Patch Queue

These PRs were inspected after the pause. The failures are not just stale
branch-protection checks; the repo diff-coverage gate reported concrete
uncovered changed lines. Assigned items have workers patching their own
branches in separate worktrees.

Local disk note: after completed Codecov worktrees pushed their fixes, their
generated `build/` directories plus stale generated build outputs from
older Codecov worktrees were removed. Source worktrees and branches were
left intact. Free space recovered from about `192 MiB` to about `4.7 GiB`.

### Queue Refill 2026-05-01 09:01 EDT

- Direct PR checks showed #1126, #1125, and #1122 were idle with no active
  runs. Their blocking checks were stale cancelled/failure wrappers from
  earlier runs, not current failures.
- Refreshed the three branches with `gh pr update-branch`, producing fresh
  heads and new PR-event workflows:
  - #1126 `feature/view-frame-clock-coverage-493-next` -> `79f2d65046d0`;
    queued Build and Test `25215188581`, Coverage `25215188580`, and
    Sanitizer Tests `25215188559`; Versioning/Skill-Sync `25215188561` and
    IWYU `25215188571` started.
  - #1125 `feature/view-asset-manager-coverage-493-next` -> `33b2a33f0203`;

    Sanitizer Tests `25215188323`; Versioning/Skill-Sync `25215188321` and
    IWYU `25215188319` started.

### Queue Refill 2026-05-01 09:04 EDT

- Subagent triage confirmed #1121 and #1118 were idle, behind current `main`,
  and blocked only by stale cancelled/failed wrapper checks. Refreshed both:
  - #1121 `feature/audio-buffering-reader-coverage-640-next` ->
    `afdff6e1cc06`; queued Build and Test `25215267350`, Coverage
    `25215267349`, and Sanitizer Tests `25215267373`; Versioning/Skill-Sync
    `25215267345` and IWYU `25215267366` started.
  - #1118 `feature/osc-bundle-coverage-641-next` -> `e85122359eb6`; queued
    Build and Test `25215267166`, Coverage `25215267197`, and Sanitizer Tests

    `25215267156`, and IWYU `25215267163` started.

### Queue Refill 2026-05-01 09:06 EDT

- Subagent triage confirmed #1117, #1116, #1115, #1114, and #1113 were idle,
  behind current `main`, and blocked only by stale wrapper checks. Refreshed the
  batch:
  - #1117 `feature/lcov-cobertura-coverage-643-next` -> `965cb2e06aa1`.
  - #1116 `feature/signal-interpolator-coverage-645-next` -> `a100d78830bf`.

  - #1113 `feature/runtime-expression-coverage-641-next` -> `93c2aea2bd75`.
- Fresh PR rollups show all five active with no current failed checks.

### Queue Refill 2026-05-01 09:10 EDT

- Subagent triage confirmed #1104, #1097, #1096, #1088, #1083, and #1078 were
  idle, behind current `main`, and blocked only by stale wrapper checks.
  Refreshed the batch:
  - #1104 `feature/cli-create-coverage-643` -> `d4c908848517`.
  - #1097 `feature/view-toolbar-coverage-493` -> `4a7000d7b2f9`.

  - #1078 `feature/runtime-gzip-header-coverage-641` -> `3a93e12603f8`.
- Fresh PR rollups show all six active with no current failed checks.
  Repository active-run count was about `85`; stop blind refilling here and
  switch to watch/fix/merge until capacity drains.
- #1072 was intentionally not refreshed because it already had active queued
  macOS checks.

## Local-Only Work Prepared During Pause

This table started as the local-only tranche queue prepared after the
Namespace pause began. Many rows now record the later PR / merge
outcome; rows marked queued or held are the ones that still need action
after capacity returns.
