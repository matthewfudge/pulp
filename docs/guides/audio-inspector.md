# Audio Inspector Guide

The **Audio Inspector** is a floating developer window in the standalone host
that observes the realtime output-boundary probe — peak/RMS levels, dBFS,
clip and NaN/Inf counts, silence runs, and callback counts. It is the audio
sibling of the `Cmd+I` layout inspector: a dev-only overlay you open while a
plugin or app is running to answer "is sound actually flowing, and what does
it look like?"

It is **live**: it reads metrics from a running audio host. This is distinct
from the offline **Audio Doctor** (`pulp audio validate ...`), which analyses
an already-rendered WAV file offline. Use the Inspector to watch a live host;
use the Doctor to assert on a captured render in CI.

## When to use it

Use the Audio Inspector when the question is about a running host, not an
offline render:

- "Is this processor producing audio at all?"
- "Did my parameter, MIDI, host graph, or importer change accidentally silence
  the standalone output?"
- "Are we clipping, producing NaN/Inf samples, or underrunning while the UI is
  open?"
- "Is the standalone host configured with the sample rate, block size, and
  channel count I expected?"
- "Can an agent get a quick machine-readable health check before deciding which
  deeper audio test to run?"

It is deliberately shallow and cheap. It does not prove frequency response,
THD, phase, latency, tuning, or golden-file parity. For those, render a WAV or
artifact bundle and use the offline Audio Doctor.

## Quick developer smoke check

For a human, the fastest path is the live window:

```bash
pulp run pulp-audio-inspector-demo --audio-inspector
```

For a quick terminal check, ask for JSON and inspect the counters:

```bash
pulp run pulp-audio-inspector-demo \
  --audio-probe-json /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-demo.json \
  --frames 90

jq '{callbacks, peak_max, rms_max, peak_dbfs, rms_dbfs, clip_count, nan_inf_count}' \
  /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-demo.json
```

For an app/plugin expected to output audio, a healthy smoke result usually has
`callbacks > 0`, non-zero `peak_max` and `rms_max`, and zero `clip_count` /
`nan_inf_count`. For an intentionally silent plugin, non-zero callbacks plus
zero levels is still useful: it says the host is running and the observed stage
is silent.

## What it observes

The probe taps the standalone host at the *output boundary* — immediately
after `Processor::process(...)` and before the device callback returns. Each
block it publishes an `AudioProbeSnapshot` (see
`pulp/audio/audio_probe_snapshot.hpp`) carrying:

- Identity: `stage`, `sample_rate`, `block_size`, `channel_count`,
  `sequence_number` (monotonic; a gap means snapshots were dropped between
  reads).
- Level: `peak_max`, `rms_max` (linear) plus `peak_dbfs` / `rms_dbfs`
  (`20*log10`).
- Content events: `clip_count`, `nan_inf_count`, `clipped_blocks`,
  `nan_blocks`, `silence_run_blocks`, `callbacks`.

## Opening it

There are three ways to open the live Inspector:

1. **In-app chord** — press `Cmd+Shift+A` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+A`
   (Windows/Linux) in a running standalone window.
2. **Environment variable** — set `PULP_AUDIO_INSPECTOR=1` before launching;
   the host opens the window at startup.
3. **CLI flag** — `pulp run --audio-inspector` (forwards
   `--audio-inspector` and sets `PULP_AUDIO_INSPECTOR=1` for the child).

```bash
# Open the live Audio Inspector alongside the running app
pulp run --audio-inspector
```

`--audio-inspector` does **not** imply `--headless` (a dev usually wants the
visible window). It composes with `--screenshot`, which is headless: a CI run
can capture the panel for visual regression.

```bash
# Headless: capture the main UI AND the inspector panel
pulp run --audio-inspector --screenshot ui.png
# → ui.png and ui.audio-inspector.png
```

## Dev-on / ship-off gating

The probe and Inspector are gated behind the `PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES` CMake
option, which is **ON by default for dev/example builds**. A release/ship
standalone configures it OFF so the shipped binary carries no probe and no
inspector surface:

```bash
# Ship build: strip the probe + inspector
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES=OFF
```

When the option is OFF, the CLI flags still parse, but the standalone host has
no probe to read. `--audio-inspector` is a no-op, and
`--audio-probe-json` is unsupported in that binary: the standalone launch fails
before the window opens, logs `PULP_ENABLE_AUDIO_PROBES=OFF`, and does not
write JSON.

## Programmatic readout: `--audio-probe-json`

A visible window is useless to an agent or a CI job — they need the scalar
facts as text. `pulp run --audio-probe-json PATH` runs the host headlessly,
lets the audio path produce a few blocks, writes the probe's latest snapshot
as a flat JSON object to `PATH`, then exits.

```bash
pulp run --audio-probe-json /tmp/probe.json
cat /tmp/probe.json
```

`--audio-probe-json` implies `--headless` (one-shot dump + exit, like
`--screenshot`). It is forwarded as `--audio-probe-json <file>` and via
`PULP_AUDIO_PROBE_JSON=<file>`. The frame delay reuses the same
`--frames` / `PULP_FRAMES` mechanism as the screenshot capture.

The JSON shape:

```json
{
  "stage": "standalone_output_boundary",
  "sample_rate": 48000.0,
  "block_size": 256,
  "channel_count": 2,
  "sequence_number": 42,
  "peak_max": 0.5,
  "rms_max": 0.25,
  "peak_dbfs": -6.0206,
  "rms_dbfs": -12.0412,
  "clip_count": 0,
  "nan_inf_count": 0,
  "clipped_blocks": 0,
  "nan_blocks": 0,
  "silence_run_blocks": 0,
  "callbacks": 99,
  "underruns": 0,
  "device_xruns": 0,
  "cpu_overloads": 0
}
```

`peak_dbfs` / `rms_dbfs` are `null` when the corresponding linear value is 0,
so a reader can distinguish true silence from a finite low level (JSON has no
infinity literal). The snapshot→JSON mapping is the pure
`pulp::audio::audio_probe_snapshot_to_json()` helper
(`pulp/audio/audio_probe_json.hpp`).

## Interpreting common JSON states

| Result | Likely meaning | Next useful step |
|---|---|---|
| `callbacks == 0` | The host did not process audio before the dump. | Increase `--frames`; check standalone launch/device setup. |
| `callbacks > 0`, `peak_max == 0`, `rms_max == 0`, dBFS fields are `null` | The observed output stage is truly silent. | If silence is unexpected, check MIDI/input routing, graph connections, bypass/mute params, or the processor's `process()` branch. |
| `peak_max > 0`, `rms_max > 0`, zero error counters | Audio is flowing at the standalone output boundary. | Use the live window for visual inspection or Audio Doctor for deeper signal quality checks. |
| `clip_count > 0` or `clipped_blocks > 0` | At least one sample hit/exceeded the clipping threshold. | Inspect gain staging and run an offline render if exact clipping location matters. |
| `nan_inf_count > 0` or `nan_blocks > 0` | The DSP produced invalid floating-point samples. | Treat as a bug; inspect DSP math/state initialization near the changed code. |
| `device_xruns > 0` or `cpu_overloads > 0` | The runtime/device reported stress while the host was running. | Recheck in Release, then profile or reduce realtime work. |
| `sequence_number` stops advancing in the live window | The probe is stale; audio processing is idle or the host stopped publishing snapshots. | Check transport/device lifecycle before debugging DSP. |

The JSON is a snapshot, not a log. If you need history, run a longer scenario
or add a purpose-built trace around the suspected path.

### MCP access

The Claude/Codex-facing path uses the existing `pulp-mcp` binary. Call
`pulp_audio_probe_json` to run the same `pulp run --audio-probe-json` one-shot
flow and receive the probe object as `structuredContent`:

```json
{
  "target": "pulp-audio-inspector-demo",
  "frames": 90
}
```

`target` is optional and maps to `pulp run <target>`. `frames` is optional and
defaults to 90. This is not a second MCP server and not the future persistent
live socket; it is the agent-friendly wrapper for the JSON dump that exists
today.

### Agent workflow

An agent working on audio software should treat `pulp_audio_probe_json` as the
first live-health check, not as a replacement for audio analysis:

1. Call `pulp_audio_probe_json` with the standalone target under investigation.
2. If the tool returns an error, report the launch/probe problem before making
   DSP claims.
3. If callbacks are zero, adjust the run length (`frames`) or inspect host
   startup.
4. If levels are silent but callbacks advance, debug routing, input stimulus,
   bypass state, graph wiring, or the processor output path.
5. If clipping or NaN/Inf counters are non-zero, prioritize DSP/gain/state bugs.
6. If the snapshot is healthy but the user reports "sounds wrong", switch to
   Audio Doctor or a scenario render; the live probe cannot diagnose spectral or
   perceptual quality.

## End-to-end demo harness

The in-tree `pulp-audio-inspector-demo` example is the recommended live proof
target. It uses `StandaloneApp::run_with_editor()` and emits a continuous sine
tone from `Processor::process()`, so the output-boundary probe has non-silent
data without a DAW, MIDI input, or a physical audio input.

```bash
# Programmatic proof: JSON should show non-zero peak/RMS and callbacks.
pulp run pulp-audio-inspector-demo \
  --audio-probe-json /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-demo.json \
  --frames 90

# Visual proof: writes the main UI plus the inspector panel sibling capture.
pulp run pulp-audio-inspector-demo \
  --audio-inspector \
  --screenshot /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-demo.png \
  --frames 90
# -> /tmp/pulp-audio-inspector-demo.audio-inspector.png
```

The committed reference captures live under
`examples/audio-inspector-demo/fixtures/` as `editor-main.png` and
`audio-inspector-panel.png`.

Use this demo for GUI end-to-end checks before changing the Inspector window,
the `pulp run` flags, or the future live MCP socket path.
