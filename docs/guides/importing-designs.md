# Importing Designs

Pulp can import designs from external tools and translate them into web-compat JS, DesignIR, baked C++/SwiftUI, or token artifacts. Supported sources: **Figma/Figma plugin**, **Google Stitch**, **v0.dev**, **Pencil/OpenPencil**, **Claude Design**, and **Google DESIGN.md** (design *system* -- tokens only, no screen).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Import a Figma export
pulp import-design --from figma --file design.json

# Import a v0.dev component
pulp import-design --from v0 --file component.tsx --output my-ui.js

# Import a Pencil design with validation
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json --validate --reference source.png

# Preview without writing files
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json --dry-run

# Export current theme as W3C Design Tokens
pulp export-tokens --tokens tokens.json
```

## How It Works

The import pipeline has three layers:

```
Figma REST/file JSON ----.
Figma plugin .pulp.zip --|
Stitch HTML / directory -|--> Normalized IR --> JS / DesignIR / baked native artifacts
v0 / Figma Make TSX ----|
Pencil/OpenPencil JSON --'

DESIGN.md ------------------> tokens.json only
```

## Source-Specific Guides

### Pencil / OpenPencil

Pencil uses Yoga layout internally (same engine as Pulp), so layout translation is nearly 1:1:

```bash
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json
```

Pencil variables map directly to Pulp theme tokens.

#### Pencil Layout Precision

For highest fidelity, agent workflows can use Pencil's `snapshot_layout` MCP tool to acquire exact pixel positions and sizes for every element before writing the JSON consumed by `pulp import-design`. That data is injected into the IR as `_layoutHeight`/`_layoutWidth` attributes, which the code generator uses instead of computing heights from children (which can differ by 5-20px due to estimation).

```
Pencil MCP workflow:
  batch_get(nodeId)        → node tree (types, styles, children)
  snapshot_layout(nodeId)  → exact pixel positions (x, y, width, height)
  export_nodes(nodeId)     → reference PNG for validation
```

#### Screenshot Naming Convention

Import validation produces three files per design:
- `{design}-{source}-source.png` — original design tool export
- `{design}-{source}-render.png` — Pulp headless render
- `{design}-{source}-diff.png` — visual diff (red = differences)

Example: `pulpgain-pencil-source.png`, `pulpgain-pencil-render.png`, `pulpgain-pencil-diff.png`

### Figma

Figma imports are file/URL based at the CLI. Use `figma-plugin` for the Pulp Figma plugin's `.pulp.json` / `.pulp.zip` envelope, or `figma` for raw REST/file JSON:

```bash
pulp import-design --from figma-plugin --file design.pulp.zip
pulp import-design --from figma --file design.json
```

Agent workflows may use Figma MCP tools to acquire source context or reference screenshots before producing those files:
- `get_design_context` — code + screenshot + design tokens in one call
- `get_screenshot` — reference PNG for validation
- `get_variable_defs` — design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- `get_metadata` — layer tree with IDs, names, types, positions, sizes

Raw MCP responses are acquisition data, not a separate CLI source. Translate or export them into one of the supported file shapes before importing.

The raw Figma and Figma Make adapter lanes are tracked in the compatibility
import reference, which records the current parser status instead of relying on
a one-off issue link.

### Google Stitch

Stitch screens are imported from HTML/directory exports or translated IR JSON. Stitch MCP can be used by an agent to acquire the screen, but the CLI still consumes a file:

```bash
pulp import-design --from stitch --file screen.html
```

Useful Stitch acquisition helpers:
- `get_screen` — HTML code + screenshot
- `get_project` — design system (50+ named colors, fonts, roundness)
- `generate_screen_from_text` — AI-generate a screen from prompt

### v0.dev

The current v0 lane accepts a v0 project envelope or a single React TSX/JSX component that stays within Pulp's supported runtime-import DOM/CSS/API subset:

```bash
pulp import-design --from v0 --file component.tsx --output my-ui.js
```

- Inline styles and supported DOM tags are normalized into the runtime import surface.
- Default Tailwind, shadcn/Radix, Next.js, and custom-component-heavy exports need preprocessing into the supported subset; they are rejected rather than partially imported.
- Simple state/value evidence is captured where the parser can prove the control contract.

### Google DESIGN.md

`DESIGN.md` is Google's YAML-frontmatter + Markdown format for
describing a design *system* (colors, typography, spacing, component
recipes), not a screen. The format is Apache-2.0; the upstream spec
lives at [github.com/google-labs-code/design.md](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md).

```bash
pulp import-design --from designmd --file path/to/DESIGN.md
```

This produces `tokens.json` in W3C DTCG format. It does **not**
produce a `ui.js`, because DESIGN.md has no screen — there's nothing
to lay out. Use this importer when you want to bring a token system
into Pulp; pair it with a screen importer (Figma, Stitch, Pencil, v0,
Claude) when you also need a UI.

The parser handles the canonical frontmatter keys (`version`, `name`,
`description`, `colors`, `typography`, `rounded`, `spacing`,
`components`), resolves `{group.key}` references at parse time, and
preserves composite typography references inside `components.*`
verbatim so downstream tooling can resolve them in widget context.
It tracks the upstream format spec at tag `0.3.0`: color values may be
any valid CSS color (hex, named, `rgb()`/`hsl()`/`oklch()`/`color-mix()`,
…), token groups nest to arbitrary depth (keyed on the dot-joined path),
`spacing` accepts bare numbers, and an unrecognized top-level key is
flagged with a warning rather than silently dropped.

Detection is strict: filename must be `DESIGN.md`, the frontmatter
fence must be present, and the frontmatter must declare `name:` plus
at least one canonical token group. A generic Jekyll blog post with
`name:` in its frontmatter will not match.

The importer is tokens-only. `pulp design lint` and `pulp design diff`
cover DESIGN.md quality and semantic token changes. Tailwind v3/v4 export
and project-source round-tripping remain future work. See
[`reference/imports/designmd.md`](../reference/imports/designmd.md)
for the full reference.

### Claude Design

Claude Design exports are standalone HTML files with an inline bundler
script tag. Pulp detects them via the `__bundler/template` script type
and parses the loader shell:

```bash
pulp import-design --from claude --file design.html --classnames classnames.json
```

The `classnames.json` artifact maps every plain-classname `<style>`
rule to its camelCase CSS properties, for downstream merge into
inline styles. See [`reference/cli.md#import-design`](../reference/cli.md#import-design).

## Audio Widget Detection

The importer auto-detects audio-specific widgets from naming conventions in your design:

| Name contains | Pulp widget |
|---------------|-------------|
| knob, dial | `createKnob()` |
| fader, slider | `createFader()` |
| meter, level, vu | `createMeter()` |
| xypad, xy_pad | `createXYPad()` |
| waveform, oscilloscope | `createWaveformView()` |
| spectrum, analyzer | `createSpectrumView()` |

**Container detection:** Frames with child frames (like "KnobRow" containing 4 knob frames) are treated as containers, not widgets. Only leaf nodes with shape children (ellipse/rectangle + text) become audio widgets.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are extracted during import and saved in [W3C Design Tokens](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) format.

### Token Aliases

W3C Design Tokens support **aliases** — tokens that reference other tokens. Pulp resolves these automatically:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "$type": "color",
    "blue": { "$value": "#3B82F6" },
    "primary": { "$value": "{color.blue}" }
  }
}
```

Chained aliases are resolved up to 10 levels deep.

### Group Type Inheritance

A group can set `$type` which applies to all children:

```json
{
  "spacing": {
    "$type": "dimension",
    "sm": { "$value": "4" },
    "md": { "$value": "8" }
  }
}
```

### Composite Tokens

Typography, shadow, and border tokens are flattened to sub-properties:

```json
{
  "heading": {
    "$type": "typography",
    "$value": { "fontFamily": "Inter", "fontSize": "24", "fontWeight": "700" }
  }
}
```

Becomes: `heading.fontFamily = "Inter"`, `heading.fontSize = 24`, `heading.fontWeight = 700`.

### Math Expressions

Token values can contain simple math: `"{spacing.base} * 2"` → resolves alias then evaluates to `16`.

### Compatibility

The W3C parser handles tokens from: Tokens Studio, Specify, Figma Variables, Stitch Design Systems, Pencil Variables, and any DTCG-format tool.

## Multi-Frame Components (mode toggles / swap links)

Some components have more than one *state frame* — e.g. a keyboard with a
**typing** mode and a **piano** mode, switched by a toggle button. A
`DesignFrameView` can hold N frames and swap which one renders:

- `add_frame(svg, elements, panel…)` registers an alternate frame (frame 0 is
  the constructor's). Each frame has its own SVG, overlay elements, and panel
  crop — and its own intrinsic size.
- `set_active_frame(i)` swaps the rendered SVG **and** the view's intrinsic
  size, then invalidates layout so the host re-sizes. It releases any held
  momentary key first (no stuck notes across a swap).
- A `DesignFrameElement` of kind **`swap`** is a swap-link button: clicking its
  rect calls `set_active_frame(target_frame)`. This is how an in-design toggle
  control (the 🎹/⌨ buttons in the Musical Typing Keyboard) drives the swap.

### Worked example — re-importing two mode frames

When a design stacks its states in one spec frame (to show them side-by-side),
import each state **sub-frame** standalone — they become the swap targets:

```bash
# Typing mode (Figma node 187:15) and piano mode (187:349) of one component.
python3 tools/import-design/figma_rest_export.py \
  --file-key <KEY> --node 187:15  --out typing.pulp.json --faithful-vector
python3 tools/import-design/figma_rest_export.py \
  --file-key <KEY> --node 187:349 --out piano.pulp.json  --faithful-vector
```

Each export's faithful SVG (a `data:image/svg+xml;base64` asset in the
`asset_manifest`) is embedded; the component adds both as frames and wires the
toggle's buttons as `swap` elements. Re-importing a revised frame is the same
command on the same node — re-export, re-embed, re-extract rects. Name the link
in plain English at import time using the interaction-linking vocabulary (swap /
resize / modal / popover / navigate / open-window / drawer); `swap` is the one
used here. (`MusicalTypingKeyboard` is the reference consumer.)

> Hit-rects for a standalone sub-frame are in the sub-frame's own coordinate
> space. Extract them from the node's `absoluteBoundingBox` geometry minus the
> frame origin (the export adds a uniform shadow margin — 6px for these frames),
> not by transcribing the combined-frame coordinates.

## Validation

### Automated Validation Loop

After generating Pulp code, validate by comparing with the source design:

```bash
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json \
  --validate --reference source.png --render-size 400x205
```

This automatically:
1. Renders generated JS headlessly
2. Compares with reference screenshot
3. Reports similarity percentage
4. Generates diff image highlighting differences

### Debug Output

```bash
pulp import-design --from pencil --file design.json --debug
```

Reports: element counts (containers/widgets/labels), token counts, timing (ms), validation results, and gaps (unmapped shapes).

## Acquisition vs Import

MCP connectors are acquisition helpers unless a source contract says otherwise. They can read a live tool, capture screenshots, or gather metadata, then an agent writes a supported file for `pulp import-design`.

| Source | Acquisition helpers | CLI input |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Figma plugin | In-tree Figma plugin or REST exporter | `.pulp.json` / `.pulp.zip` with `--from figma-plugin` |
| Figma / Figma Make | Figma MCP or REST data acquisition | Raw Figma JSON or constrained React TSX via `--from figma` |
| Stitch | Stitch MCP or directory export | HTML/directory export or translated IR via `--from stitch` |
| Pencil/OpenPencil | Pencil MCP / OpenPencil export | JSON export or translated node data via `--from pencil` |
| v0.dev | v0 MCP/project access | Project envelope or constrained React TSX via `--from v0` |

Current runtime parsers reject raw provider MCP JSON unless that source's parser explicitly documents the shape.
