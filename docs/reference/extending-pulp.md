# Extending Pulp: `add` vs `tool` vs `kit` vs `content`

Pulp has four distinct ways to bring something extra into your workflow. They
look similar on the command line but serve different purposes, live in different
places, and have different blast radii. Pick the wrong one and you either ship a
developer tool inside a plugin or pollute a project lockfile with something that
should have stayed on your machine — so this page exists to keep the choice
obvious.

The one-sentence rule of thumb:

- **`pulp add` / packages** — add a third-party *audio DSP library* to a *project*.
- **`pulp kit`** — share reusable *Pulp code, UI, and templates* into a *project*.
- **`pulp content`** — install *data-only packs* (presets, samples) for an
  installed *plugin*.
- **`pulp tool`** — install *developer/agent tooling* onto your *machine*.

## Comparison

| Mechanism | Command | What it adds | Where it lands | Mutates your project? | Ships inside your plugin? | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Packages** | `pulp add <pkg>` | Curated, license-checked third-party **audio DSP libraries** (pitch detection, time-stretch, SRC, file decoders, …) beyond `core/signal/` | `packages.lock.json` + generated CMake wiring in your project; `DEPENDENCIES.md` / `NOTICE.md` | **Yes** — lockfile, CMake, attribution | Yes — it becomes a build dependency of your plugin | You need a DSP capability your plugin will actually link and ship |
| **Kits** *(experimental)* | `pulp kit …` | Reusable **Pulp-authored code, UI, and templates**, gated by a review step before they touch a project | Your project source tree | **Yes** — adds reviewed code/UI/templates | Yes, if you build it in | You want to reuse or share UI/code scaffolding across projects |
| **Content** *(experimental)* | `pulp content …` | **Data-only** content packs (presets, sample sets, etc.) for an already-installed plugin | The plugin's content directories | No source change | No — it's data the plugin loads, not code | You want to distribute/install presets or samples for a plugin |
| **Tools** | `pulp tool install <id>` | **Machine-level developer/agent tooling**: format validators, framework importers, the `video-proof` recorder/composer | `~/.pulp/tools/` on your machine | **No** — never touches a project | **No** — never part of a shipped artifact or public CI | You need a dev tool, not a project dependency |

### The `pulp add` aliasing nuance

`pulp add` is a convenience entry point that dispatches by what you name:

- `pulp add <registry-package>` → the **package** lane (project dependency).
- `pulp add <importer>` → an **alias for `pulp tool install <importer>`** (a
  machine-level tool).

So the same verb can land in two different lanes. If you want to be unambiguous,
use `pulp add` only for DSP packages and `pulp tool install` for tools/importers.

## Why these are separate (not one mechanism)

The split is deliberate and load-bearing:

- **Trust boundary.** `pulp add` / kits / content can mutate a *project* —
  lockfiles, generated CMake, attribution files, plugin data. A plugin you ship
  to users should only ever contain code and data it actually needs at runtime.
- **No dev tooling in shipped artifacts.** `pulp tool` installs things like
  Node, npm packages, `ffmpeg`, and Remotion (for `video-proof`), or framework
  importers with bundled libclang. None of that belongs in a plugin binary, a
  project lockfile, or required public CI. Tools live under `~/.pulp/tools/` and
  are removable without touching any project.
- **License hygiene.** Packages are curated to MIT/BSD/Apache so they are safe to
  link and redistribute. Some tools (Remotion, ffmpeg static builds) carry
  developer-only license terms and get the same carve-out as vendor SDKs:
  developer-supplied, never vendored, never shipped.

## FAQ

**Why isn't `video-proof` a `pulp add` package?**
Because it is machine-level developer/agent tooling (Node, ffmpeg, Remotion,
screen-recording permissions, Terminal handoff, simulators), not something your
plugin links or ships. Making it a `pulp add` package would put unshipped
developer tooling — and license-sensitive binaries — into your project's
dependency graph. It installs with `pulp tool install video-proof` and lives
under `~/.pulp/tools/`. See
[desktop-video-proofs.md](desktop-video-proofs.md).

**Is `pulp tool` a new mechanism built for video-proof?**
No. The `pulp tool` lane already existed for format validators and framework
importers (see
[framework-importer-packaging.md](framework-importer-packaging.md)).
`video-proof` is registered as one more tool on that existing lane — it reuses
what was already built rather than inventing a new install path.

**What's the difference between a kit and a package?**
A **package** is an external third-party DSP library wired into your build via
`pulp add`. A **kit** is reusable *Pulp-authored* code, UI, or templates shared
into your project with a review step. Packages bring outside code in; kits move
Pulp-shaped building blocks between projects.

**Content vs kit?**
**Content** is data only — presets, samples, and similar packs an installed
plugin loads at runtime. A **kit** carries code/UI/templates. If it runs, it's a
kit; if the plugin merely reads it, it's content.

**Does installing a tool change my repository?**
No. Tools install under `~/.pulp/tools/` and mutate nothing in your project — no
lockfile, no CMake, no attribution. Uninstalling a tool (and, for importers, its
skill) leaves the project untouched.

**If a tool isn't installed and I ask for something that needs it, what happens?**
The command degrades to a clear skip with a single remediation line (for
example, `pulp tool install video-proof`) and still produces whatever it can
without the tool — never a false success.
