# Web Plugin Support: WAMv2 and WebCLAP

What a Pulp `Processor` can become in the browser, what is verified today, and
the exact toolchains involved. This page is the honest capability reference; the
architecture and workflow live in [../guides/web-plugins.md](../guides/web-plugins.md).

A consistency lint (`tools/scripts/check_web_plugin_docs.py`) verifies that the
helpers, files, and targets named here actually exist in the tree, so this page
cannot drift into claiming a capability the repo does not have.

## Two web lanes, two toolchains (by design)

| Lane | Toolchain | What it produces | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **WAMv2** (Web Audio Modules v2) | Emscripten (`emcc`) | An ES-module + AudioWorklet plugin | **partial** — working canary |
| **WebCLAP** (`.wclap`) | wasi-sdk (`wasm32-wasi-threads`) | A CLAP compiled to WebAssembly | **experimental** — hosted in Node and in the browser (audio + parameter control proven) |

The two tracks deliberately use different toolchains: WAMv2 *wants* Emscripten's
AudioWorklet/JS glue, while WebCLAP wants wasi-sdk (Clang + WASI sysroot, no JS
glue). WASM is required for both — a Pulp `Processor` is C++ DSP, so it must
compile to WebAssembly to run in a browser.

## WAMv2 — supported today

Build a `Processor` to a WAMv2 plugin with `pulp_add_wam_plugin`
(`tools/cmake/PulpWam.cmake`); see [cmake.md](cmake.md#pulp_add_wam_plugin). The
shared `wam_*` C ABI lives in `core/format/src/wasm/wam_entry.cpp`; the runtime
JS (AudioWorklet processor, main-thread `WebAudioModule`, heap bridge) lives in
`core/format/src/wasm/` (`wam-processor.js`, `wam-plugin.js`, `wam-runtime.mjs`).

**Verified `Processor` features** (effect PulpGain, rich effect PulpChorus,
instrument PulpPluck):

| Feature | Verified by |
| --- | --- |
| Audio process (effect), finite, non-silent | Node runner + browser fixture |
| dB-accurate gain, interleaved stereo, bypass | native bridge test + Node runner |
| Generated parameter controls in a browser | OfflineAudioContext browser fixture |
| MIDI note-on → sound, decay after note-off (instrument) | Node feature runner |
| MIDI delivery to the processor | native bridge test |
| Parameter read-back + state save/restore | native bridge test + Node runner |

**Not yet in scope for the WAMv2 canary:**

- Full WAM-host (`WamEnv` / `WamGroup`) conformance.
- More than stereo, or more than one instance per AudioWorkletNode.
- Broader MIDI than note/CC (pitch bend, aftertouch, program change, sysex,
  MPE).
- Broader-than-stereo / multi-instance hosting and full WAM-host conformance.

## WebCLAP — hosted in Node and in the browser (audio + parameter control proven)

A `Processor` compiles to a **live WebCLAP module** that a pure-JS host drives
through the full CLAP lifecycle, renders audio, and controls by parameter. Build
one with `pulp_add_wclap` (`tools/cmake/PulpWclap.cmake`) configured with the
wasi-sdk toolchain (`tools/cmake/wasi-toolchain.cmake`); the entry point uses
`PULP_WCLAP_PLUGIN` from `core/format/include/pulp/format/web/wclap_adapter.hpp`.
The checked-in example is `examples/web-demos/wclap-build/` (PulpGain →
`PulpGain.wasm`).

The output `.wasm` exports the WebCLAP host contract: the standard CLAP
`clap_entry` global, `malloc`/`free`/`cabi_realloc`, a growable function table,
and a shared, host-imported memory.

**Two host-side tools** (both in `core/format/src/wasm/`):

| Tool | Proves |
| --- | --- |
| `wclap_probe.mjs` | Module is live: `_initialize` runs; `clap_entry` resolves to a CLAP 1.2.2 entry with callable init/deinit/get_factory. |
| `wclap_host_runner.mjs` | Full host: `create_plugin` → `init` → `activate` → `process`. Renders a stereo block (passthrough at unity) and, with an injected param-value event, drives a parameter (PulpGain `Input Gain +6 dB` → output rises exactly +6 dB). |

The host callbacks (`clap_host_t`) are synthesized from JS using tiny wasm
*trampoline* modules (`core/format/src/wasm/wclap-host.mjs`), so **no compiled
C++ host shim is needed** and there is **no dependency on `WebAssembly.Function`**
— the host runs unchanged in Node and in the browser. `wclap-wasi.mjs` is the
shared WASI shim.

**In-browser host:** `examples/web-demos/wclap-build/browser-host/` hosts the same
module on the browser main thread with a generated control per parameter. It is
headless-validated against Chrome/Canary (`validate.mjs`): the plugin activates,
renders audio at unity, and a UI control drives `Input Gain +6 dB` to lift the
output ~+6 dB. The module imports a shared `WebAssembly.Memory`, so the page must
be cross-origin isolated — `serve.mjs` sends the COOP/COEP headers.

**Why the toolchain is what it is** (these are hard constraints, not choices):

- The **threaded** wasi target (`wasm32-wasi-threads`) is required — the state
  store transitively needs `std::thread`.
- Its libc++abi ships **without an exception runtime**, so the WebCLAP source
  set builds with `-fno-exceptions`. The portable `PULP_TRY` / `PULP_CATCH_ALL`
  macros in `core/runtime/include/pulp/runtime/exceptions.hpp` keep the one
  defensive try/catch compiling in both modes, and the JSON/filesystem-bound
  native PresetManager is replaced by the headless
  `core/state/src/wasm/preset_manager_wasm.cpp` (a browser sandbox has no preset
  filesystem).

**Not yet in scope:**

- **Real-time AudioWorklet streaming.** The browser host renders blocks on the
  main thread and plays them via an `AudioBuffer`. Streaming live through an
  `AudioWorklet` (host on a worker, the worklet draining a `SharedArrayBuffer`
  ring) is a later refinement.
- A native Wasmtime bridge (hosting a WebCLAP outside the browser/Node).

## Continuous validation

The `Web Plugins` CI lane (`.github/workflows/web-plugins.yml`) builds both web
formats on a Linux runner (emsdk + wasi-sdk + Chrome) and runs every validation
on each web-touching PR: the WAMv2 Node feature runner + web-build report + the
browser fixture (`examples/web-demos/wasm-build/browser-test/`), and the WebCLAP
probe + Node host runner + packaging test + the in-browser host
(`examples/web-demos/wclap-build/browser-host/`). The browser fixtures run in
headless Chrome via `playwright-core`; their screenshots upload as an artifact.
So the browser proofs are CI-enforced, not by-hand.
