/// @file host_quirks.hpp
/// Per-host accommodation flags consumed by format adapters.
///
/// Pulp's format adapters (VST3, AU v2, AU v3, CLAP, AAX) consult a
/// `HostQuirks` struct at init time to switch between defensive defaults
/// (always-on) and host-gated behaviors (only when a specific DAW /
/// version is detected). The full catalog of accommodations lives in
/// `planning/2026-05-24-daw-host-quirks-inheritance.md`.
///
/// Reviewer decision (2026-05-25): cheap defenses are always-on, expensive
/// defenses are host-gated. Always-on defaults are seeded by the
/// default-constructed `HostQuirks`; host-gated flags are turned on by
/// the per-host factory headers under `host_quirks/<host>.hpp`.
///
/// **License-hygiene contract**: every fix that flips a host-gated flag
/// must cite a host vendor doc + a reproducer Pulp issue. The commit
/// trailer `Reference-Lineage: cleanroom reproducer=#NNNN docs=<url>`
/// is required (advisory pre-push warning hint will catch missing
/// trailers on commits touching `core/format/host_quirks/`).
///
/// ## Per-quirk validation tiers (2026-05-25)
///
/// Not every quirk has been bench-validated against a real DAW. We tag
/// each flag with one of three `QuirkStatus` tiers so plugin authors
/// can dial in exactly the accommodations they trust:
///
///   * `Validated` — exercised against the named DAW under a Pulp
///     regression test that observed the symptom + the fix.
///   * `Speculative` — implemented per host docs + reproducer report
///     but not yet confirmed in-DAW from a Pulp test bench. Default
///     ON when the host is detected, but a plugin author can opt out
///     via `QuirkFilter{ .allow_speculative = false }`.
///   * `LessonOnly` — the quirk row exists in the catalog as a
///     historical lesson; no Pulp fix is wired yet. Carried so the
///     enum + meta stay consistent with the catalog (the field's
///     default in `HostQuirks` is the safe value).
///
/// See `docs/reference/host-quirks-policy.md` for the full opt-in /
/// opt-out story (plugin-author surface) and
/// `planning/host-quirks-log.md` for the discovery log.
