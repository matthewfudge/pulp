# Signal Graph Reference

`pulp::host::SignalGraph` is the DAG engine that connects `PluginSlot`
instances (and built-in nodes: input, output, gain, MIDI in/out) into a
routable audio topology.

## Nodes

| NodeType       | Role                                      | Ports |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|-------|
| `Input`        | Source from the host's input bus          | 0 in → N out |
| `Output`       | Sink to the host's output bus             | N in → 0 out |
| `Gain`         | Scalar gain, no allocation                | 1 in → 1 out |
| `Plugin`       | Wraps a `PluginSlot`                      | N in → N out |
| `MidiInput`    | Source for MIDI events                    | 0 in → 1 out |
| `MidiOutput`   | Sink for MIDI events                      | 1 in → 0 out |
| `Custom`       | String-keyed extension node               | Registered shape |

Each node has a stable `NodeId` that survives connection edits. The graph
owns the nodes; removing a node invalidates its id.

Custom node types are registered per graph with `CustomNodeType`
(`type_id`, `version`, input ports, output ports, default name) before
calling `add_custom_node(type_id)`. Graph serialization stores the custom
`type_id` and `version` so a topology can be reloaded on another machine.
If the target graph has not registered the matching factory, the loader still
creates a placeholder `Custom` node with the saved identity and port shape and
reports the unresolved type in `LoadResult::missing_custom_node_types`.

## Connections

`connect(from, from_port, to, to_port)` adds an audio edge and returns
false if it would create a cycle (`would_create_cycle()` exposes the same
check without mutating). Disconnect by `NodeId`, port, or by full edge.

Four connection variants cover the non-audio-passthrough cases:

- `connect_midi(from, to)` routes `MidiBuffer` events between node-scoped
  MIDI in/out buffers (ports are ignored). Participates in cycle
  detection the same way audio edges do. `inject_midi(node, buf)` loads
  a `MidiInput`'s output before a block; `extract_midi(node, &out)`
  drains a `MidiOutput`'s input after a block.
- `connect_feedback(from, port, to, port)` closes a cycle with an
  explicit one-block delay — the destination reads the source's previous
  block's output. Invisible to the topological sort and PDC so the
  runtime stays DAG-ordered.
- `connect_automation(from, port, plugin, param, lo, hi)` samples a source
  audio port at the start and end of the block and delivers sparse
  `ParameterEvent`s into `PluginSlot::process()`.
- `connect_audio_rate_modulation(from, port, plugin, param, lo, hi)` declares
  a dense per-sample modulation edge. It is accepted only for continuous,
  automatable `HostParamInfo::rate == AudioRate` parameters, emits one
  `ParameterEvent` per sample, and participates in latency alignment.
- Sidechain is *not* a separate API: connect a secondary source to the
  plugin node's sidechain audio-port indices (e.g. `connect(side, 0, p,
  2)` when the plugin exposes ports 2/3 as its sidechain bus).

## Processing order

`processing_order()` returns the topological sort. The audio callback
walks this vector once per block:

1. Input nodes copy from the host buffer to their output port.
2. Plugin nodes call `PluginSlot::process()` with their gathered inputs.
3. Gain nodes multiply in place.
4. Custom nodes pass audio inputs through to matching output ports unless a
   future registered implementation gives them behavior.
5. MIDI nodes route events the same way audio flows.
6. Output nodes copy to the host buffer.

Topological sort is stable: for a given set of nodes and connections, the
resulting order is deterministic, so routing is reproducible across runs.

## Latency & PDC

Every `PluginSlot` reports `latency_samples()`. During `prepare()` the
graph walks the topology, computes each node's input / output latency,
and allocates per-connection delay lines so parallel branches converge
aligned. Query results with `SignalGraph::latency_samples()` (graph-wide
total) and `node_latency_samples(id)` (alignment at a specific node).
Feedback edges (`connect_feedback`) don't contribute to PDC — the
one-block delay absorbs their alignment.
Audio-rate modulation edges do contribute to PDC: when a parameter is driven
from a lower-latency branch than the destination plugin's audio input, the
graph delays the dense parameter-event stream by the same amount as an audio
connection.

## Parameters

`set_node_parameter(node, id, value)` forwards a normalized value to the
plugin via `PluginSlot::set_parameter()`; `get_node_parameter(node, id)`
reads back. `connect_automation()` delivers two sparse control points per
block for control-rate movement. `connect_audio_rate_modulation()` delivers
sample-by-sample events for parameters explicitly marked audio-rate.

## Persistence

`GraphSerializer` writes `.pulpgraph` JSON with a `format_version` field.
Loaders read that field before materializing nodes. Older graph versions can
register `GraphSerializer::register_migration()` steps to upgrade JSON to the
current format; newer or unreadable versions fail closed instead of being
silently interpreted as current data.

## Thread model

- **Build & edit** (add / connect / remove) runs on the UI thread.
- **Process** runs on the audio thread over the snapshotted processing
  order. The snapshot is swapped under a lock-free publish so edits never
  tear the running order.
- **Load** (`PluginSlot::load`) runs on a worker thread; the returned
  slot is handed to the graph only after it's fully loaded.
