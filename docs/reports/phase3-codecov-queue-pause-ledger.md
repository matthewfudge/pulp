# Phase 3 Codecov Queue Pause Ledger

Last updated: 2026-05-01 EDT

This local ledger records the open `codecov` PR validation runs paused to free Namespace capacity for higher-priority work, plus the small-batch resume queue. Branches, PRs, commits, labels, and tracker comments stay intact; queued GitHub Actions validation attempts are cancellable and replaceable.

## Queue Policy

- Reopen Codecov validation in small batches; do not dump the full paused queue back into Namespace at once.
- While a batch is in flight, continue local-only tranche preparation, review, and failure triage.
- Merge `UNSTABLE` PRs only when GitHub branch protection shows all required checks are green and the PR can merge normally.
- For merge eligibility after a pause, refresh PR branches with `gh pr update-branch <pr>` so GitHub creates fresh `pull_request` check suites.
- Use `shipyard cloud run build <branch> --provider namespace --require-sha <sha> --no-wait` only as a Namespace smoke or targeted diagnostic; successful `workflow_dispatch` checks do not replace stale failed or cancelled `pull_request` contexts for branch protection.
- If one lane is slow or stuck, prefer `shipyard cloud retarget`/`shipyard cloud add-lane` so existing useful runs are preserved instead of cancelled wholesale.

## Snapshot Summary

- Open `codecov` PRs in snapshot: 73
- Queued/in-progress Codecov-branch workflow runs selected for cancellation: 193
- Selected workflows: Build and Test, Coverage, Sanitizer Tests

## Cancellation Result

- Cancellation pass completed on 2026-04-30 EDT.
- Cancellation requests submitted successfully for all 193 recorded runs.
- A few runs completed while cancellation was in flight; sticky queued
  runs for #1133 and #1134 required a second cancellation request.
- Final verification after GitHub settled: 0 queued or in-progress
  workflow runs remained for the open `codecov` PR branches in this
  snapshot.
- Expected side effect: cancelled validation attempts may leave PRs
  `BLOCKED` or `UNSTABLE` until the queue is reopened and fresh
  validation runs are dispatched.

## Resume Batches

### 2026-05-01 Batch 1: Build Gate Refill

Namespace capacity check showed no queued or in-progress GitHub workflow
runs for `danielraffel/pulp`, so the first refill batch replaced only the
cancelled `Build and Test` gates for recent Codecov PRs. Existing passing
Codecov/version/docs/license results were left intact.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `bf87273e0534` | Build and Test | `25202620106` | in progress |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `2d2c119b4c8d` | Build and Test | `25202620128` | in progress |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `cb6fb9c4e9c3` | Build and Test | `25202620088` | in progress |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `2b2ccde36e63` | Build and Test | `25202620280` | in progress |

Next refill rule: when this batch drops below four active Codecov build
runs, dispatch the next merge-ready paused PRs by pinned SHA and update
this table before adding more local-only tranche PRs.

Follow-up correction: these `workflow_dispatch` runs all passed, but they
did not satisfy branch protection because stale failed or cancelled
`pull_request` check runs with the same required context names remained on
the PR head commits. The branches were then refreshed against `main` with
`gh pr update-branch` to create merge-eligible PR-event check suites:

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1140 | `feature/status-ladder-coverage-643` | `f48a49e62ec3` | `25203370720` | `25203370713` | pending |
| #1141 | `feature/ship-appcast-coverage-644-next` | `bccfec4797d5` | `25203371862` | `25203371864` | pending |
| #1142 | `codex/package-tools-coverage-643` | `45dbdda453a3` | `25203373031` | `25203372990` | pending |
| #1143 | `feature/render-compute-coverage-646` | `14098f98d57e` | `25203374251` | `25203374250` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 2: Build Gate Refill

The first batch assigned cleanly on Namespace with no GitHub queued-run
backlog, so a second four-PR batch was queued behind it. This keeps the
active window warm without re-dispatching the full paused set.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `46854e04fcf2` | Build and Test | `25202718222` | queued |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `5149c107a3ac` | Build and Test | `25202718230` | queued |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `6fea2fa4686a` | Build and Test | `25202718329` | queued |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `a6237254b05d` | Build and Test | `25202718395` | queued |

Note: `shipyard cloud run build` printed older saved run IDs for #1136
and #1137, but `gh run list` confirmed the fresh workflow_dispatch run
IDs above.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 3: Build Gate Refill

A third build-only batch was queued after #1136-#1139. #1131 was not
queued because its `Diff coverage required` check is red and needs
coverage-gate triage before a build-only re-run can make it mergeable.

| PR | Branch | Head | Workflow | New Run | Status at Dispatch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `2695097458c4` | Build and Test | `25202770455` | queued |
| #1133 | `feature/audio-channel-set-coverage-640-next` | `df227394cd7e` | Build and Test | `25202770462` | queued |
| #1134 | `codex/coverage-phase3-tranche-20260430095455` | `1dbd12f64ba0` | Build and Test | `25202770509` | queued |
| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `89242ca0bfa5` | Build and Test | `25202770726` | queued |

Held for triage: #1131 `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next`
has passing `codecov/patch` but failing `Diff coverage required`, so it
likely needs a coverage workflow re-run or a patch rather than build-only
refill.

Follow-up correction: because build-only dispatches do not clear stale
PR-event contexts, the queued or running build-only dispatches for
#1132-#1139 were cancelled after the #1140-#1143 branch-refresh batch
started. Cancelled workflow_dispatch run IDs: `25202718222`,
`25202718230`, `25202718329`, `25202718395`, `25202770455`,
`25202770462`, `25202770509`, and `25202770726`.

### 2026-05-01 Batch 4: PR-Event Branch Refresh

After confirming the build-only dispatches were not merge-eligible
evidence, the next refill batch used `gh pr update-branch` so GitHub
created fresh required `pull_request` checks.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1135 | `feature/signal-processor-chain-reset-coverage-645` | `bc32ea5904b6` | `25203513486` | `25203513496` | pending |
| #1136 | `feature/package-registry-cache-fallback-643-next` | `476677d7b926` | `25203494171` | `25203494182` | pending |
| #1137 | `feature/audio-platform-helper-coverage-640-next` | `cc7fcaf98be8` | `25203494454` | `25203494423` | pending |
| #1138 | `feature/coverage-no-idle-guidance-641` | `72fa08f3553a` | `25203493849` | `25203493834` | pending |
| #1139 | `codex/events-phase3-coverage-tranche` | `df3f376fa716` | `25203493795` | `25203493796` | pending |

### 2026-05-01 Batch 5: PR-Event Branch Refresh

Namespace still had the earlier PR-event batch queued but not failing, so
the next low-risk stale build-matrix PRs were refreshed in a small batch.

| PR | Branch | Refreshed Head | Build Run | Coverage Run | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1129 | `feature/midi-sysex-accumulator-coverage-645-next` | `a5ae96aa067c` | `25203575118` | `25203575127` | pending |
| #1132 | `codex/midi-sysex-sidecar-tests` | `8b403641dfd4` | `25203575435` | `25203575450` | pending |
| #1133 | `feature/audio-channel-set-coverage-640-next` | `a82513bedc13` | `25203575337` | `25203575346` | pending |
| #1134 | `codex/coverage-phase3-tranche-20260430095455` | `8c91ac2d0315` | `25203575338` | `25203575315` | pending |

## Merge Waves While Queue Is In Flight

These PRs were already green/mergeable when the paused queue was
reopened, so they were squash-merged without consuming additional
Namespace capacity. #1099 became conflicted after the preceding view
coverage merges and is held for a branch refresh.

## Conflict And Failure Triage

| PR | Branch | New Head | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1099 | `feature/view-layout-widgets-coverage-493` | `66decf5958e8` | Conflict resolved and pushed; normal PR workflows are running. Local worker validated `pulp-test-view-layout-widgets`, `pulp-test-phase9-widgets`, and `pulp-test-property-list` directly. |
| #1084 | `feature/runtime-text-diff-coverage-641` | `cb63e51416ed` | Conflict resolved and pushed; normal PR workflows are running. Local worker validated `pulp-test-runtime-utils "[runtime][text-diff]"` and matching CTest cases. |
| #1089 | `feature/view-file-browser-coverage-493` | `86cbe4ca12e9` | Conflict resolved and pushed. The first refreshed run failed `Enforce version & skill sync`; a metadata-only empty commit added `Version-Bump: sdk=skip reason="test-only file browser coverage; no SDK release surface change"`. Local worker validated skill-sync, version-bump with required-bump enforcement, and `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD`. Fresh PR checks are queued. |
| #1131 | `feature/audio-window-enumerator-coverage-640-next` | `f5af90f4f5af` | Pushed coverage-harness fix for Windows `.exe` object discovery in `scripts/run_coverage.sh`; `bash -n`, `test_run_coverage.py`, skill-sync report, version-bump report, and `git diff --check` passed. Local CMake validation was not rerun after the harness patch because the laptop filesystem had only about 150-211 MiB free; the earlier excerpt binary validation was already green and the platform-sensitive coverage fix now needs CI/Namespace. |

## Real Diff-Gap Patch Queue

These PRs were inspected after the pause. The failures are not just stale
branch-protection checks; the repo diff-coverage gate reported concrete
uncovered changed lines. Assigned items have workers patching their own
branches in separate worktrees.

| #1075 | `feature/cli-host-coverage-643` | diff gate passed; failure was Windows coverage summary upload plumbing | rerun after harness/queue clears or patch summary upload if repeatable |

Local disk note: after completed Codecov worktrees pushed their fixes, their
generated `build/` directories plus stale generated build outputs from
older Codecov worktrees were removed. Source worktrees and branches were
left intact. Free space recovered from about `192 MiB` to about `3.6 GiB`.

## Local-Only Work Prepared During Pause

These branches were prepared after the Namespace pause began. They have
not been pushed, PR'd, or dispatched to Namespace.
