# Bridge stress-test catalogs

Static fixture catalogs used by `tools/stress-bridge/pulp-stress-bridge` to
drive adversarial validation of pulp's `@pulp/react` + DOM-lite + Canvas2D
bridges. See umbrella issue [#1387][umbrella].

These TSVs are committed so CI does **not** depend on network access at
runtime. They are refreshed manually on a quarterly cadence (or sooner if
a Spectr-driven gap surfaces a missing prop).

## Format

Each row is tab-separated:

```
prop<TAB>value_type<TAB>notes
```

- `prop` — canonical name (CSS dash-case for Yoga / MDN; RN camelCase for `rn-viewstyle.tsv`).
- `value_type` — coarse category the harness uses to pick adversarial inputs:
  - `enum` — `notes` lists the allowed string values, comma-separated.
  - `length` — px or unitless number.
  - `percentage` — `<n>%` string.
  - `number` — bare number (incl. negative, fractional).
  - `length-or-percentage`, `length-or-percentage-or-auto` — combined forms.
  - `color` — CSS color (hex / rgb / rgba / hsl / named).
  - `transform-array` — RN array form (`[{ rotate: '45deg' }]`).
  - `shadow-offset` — RN object form (`{ width, height }`).
  - `edge-set` — shorthand expanded to per-edge values (top/right/bottom/left).
  - `string` — opaque CSS string (e.g. `box-shadow`, `filter`).
  - `css-property` — used for the MDN catalog where we only track the prop
    name, not the value grammar.
- `notes` — optional; for enums, the comma-separated value list. For
  unusual props (logical, RTL-relative, platform-gated) a short tag.

Properties are alphabetized within each file (case-insensitive) and
deduplicated. There is intentionally no header row — the file is a flat
catalog and tooling reads it line by line.

## Refresh process

These catalogs are produced semi-manually because:

- The Yoga page is small enough (~30 props) that hand maintenance is cheaper than scraping.
- The RN ViewStyle page is small (~50 props) and value semantics need a human eye.
- The MDN index is ~470 entries and is the only one that benefits from automation.

Refresh steps:

1. Open each source URL.
2. Pull the prop list (the WebFetch tool in agent loops is fine; for
   humans, `curl ... | <markdown extractor>` is also fine).
3. Diff against the existing TSV.
4. Add new rows in alphabetical position; preserve existing `notes`.
5. If the value type schema needs to grow (e.g. a new `value_type` tag),
   update this README and the harness `value_type → fixture generator`
   table in `tools/stress-bridge/SPEC.md`.

A future PR can wire this into a `tools/stress-bridge/refresh-catalogs.py`
script that scrapes and rewrites in one shot, but the first pass is
manual on purpose to avoid baking a flaky scraper into CI.

## Refresh cadence

- **Quarterly** baseline refresh.
- **On demand** when an `import-design` consumer (Spectr, etc.) reports
  a prop the bridge doesn't recognise — add the row, file the gap, run
  the harness against it.
- **Before each Pulp minor release** as part of the bridge-hardening
  checklist.

## Overlap with `compat.json`

`compat.json` (at repo root) is the **implementation status matrix** —
every prop that has a known mapping into pulp's bridge, with
`supported / partial / missing / wontfix`. These TSVs are the
**reference catalog** — every prop the spec says exists, regardless of
whether pulp implements it.

The two are joined by `pulp-stress-bridge`:

- TSV row exists, no `compat.json` row → harness reports
  `silent-noop` and the row should be backfilled into `compat.json`
  with `status: missing`.
- Both exist, harness renders cleanly → status promoted toward
  `supported` (with the harness fixture path recorded in `tests`).
- Both exist, harness shows visual diff → status downgraded to
  `partial` and a tracker issue is filed.
