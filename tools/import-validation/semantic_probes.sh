# semantic_probes.sh — semantic-probe vector for the Spectr import-validation
# harness.
#
# Pixel diff alone has known blind spots: a Spectr render that "looks right"
# can still have silent runtime-import failures (soft error written to
# __pulpRuntimeImportErr__) or never actually finish (no mounted/settled
# phase reached). This script complements the pixel diff with three semantic
# assertions over artifacts produced by an earlier Spectr launch.
#
# This is a codex-required addition to
# planning/spectr-validated-runtime-import-product-spec.md — pixel diff is
# necessary but not sufficient. The probes below catch failure modes the
# diff cannot:
#
#   Probe 1 (runtime-import soft error)
#       __pulpRuntimeImportErr__ is set when the C++ bridge's
#       install_runtime_import_handlers() path traps a bundle-eval failure
#       (Babel transform, payload eval, missing-host-primitive). The JS
#       shim is supposed to surface it to opts.onError, but if the host
#       app never wires up onError the render keeps going with a partially
#       initialized React tree — pixel diff might still score above
#       threshold because some chrome painted. Probe 1 fails on any
#       non-empty value.
#
#   Probe 2 (lifecycle reached the end)
#       The runtime-import path should emit `phase=mounted` (React commit
#       completed) and `phase=settled` (rAF / useEffect queues drained
#       after __pulpRuntimeSettle__). If either marker is missing the
#       render is suspect — a stale paint from a previous mount, or a
#       commit that bailed before settle. Pixel diff has no notion of
#       "did the lifecycle finish."
#
#   Probe 3 (canvas actually painted)
#       The central canvas region (Spectr's spectrum gradient + band
#       columns) must have non-trivial pixel content above the near-black
#       threshold. A blank canvas with intact chrome can pass an overall
#       histogram diff because the chrome dominates the histogram. Probe 3
#       calls diff_against_reference_regions.py and inspects
#       central_canvas.blank_candidate — fails if the canvas region is
#       blank.
#
# Usage:
#   semantic_probes.sh --log <runtime.log> --screenshot <candidate.png>
#                      [--reference <reference.png>]
#                      [--regions <regions.json>]
#                      [--require-trace]
#                      [--json]
#
# Inputs:
#   --log         Runtime log from Spectr (default
#                 /tmp/spectr-rt-runtime.log, the path spectr-roundtrip.sh
#                 writes). Probes 1 + 2 read this. If the file is missing,
#                 probes 1 + 2 are reported as SKIP and probe 3 still runs.
#   --screenshot  Captured PNG of the live Spectr window (required for
#                 probe 3).
#   --reference   Ground-truth PNG to diff against. Defaults to
#                 planning/screenshots/REFERENCE-spectr-editor-html.png.
#   --regions     Optional regions JSON (defaults to the built-in Spectr
#                 layout in diff_against_reference_regions.py).
#   --require-trace
#                 Treat missing __pulpRuntimeTrace__ lines as a hard FAIL
#                 even when the log file exists. Default is to WARN — the
#                 trace globals are still being wired into Spectr's bridge,
#                 so we don't want to block harness
#                 adoption on instrumentation that doesn't ship yet.
#   --json        Emit a single JSON object summarizing all probes
#                 (overall_passed + per-probe verdicts). Default is
#                 human-readable.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every probe that ran PASSED (skipped probes do not fail).
#   1  at least one probe FAILED.
#   2  invalid arguments / artifacts unusable (e.g. no screenshot at all).
#
# Constraints:
#   - Plain bash + python3 only; no extra deps beyond what the existing
#     diff scripts already require (Pillow).
#   - Must work standalone: pass it artifacts from any earlier run, no
#     Spectr launch required.
