/// @file host_quirks/fl_studio.hpp
/// Per-host quirks for Image-Line FL Studio (macOS plan item 5.7).
///
/// DAW-quirks rows 13 + 14 (VST3):
///   * row 13: FL's Patcher routing layer violates the VST3 activation
///     contract — it can call `process()` before `setActive(true)` and
///     can call `setBusArrangements()` concurrently with `process()`.
///     The adapter must wrap `setActive` / `process` / `setBusArrangements`
///     in a mutex when FL Studio is detected to prevent state races and
///     undefined-behavior overlap. Cheaper than diagnosing the data race
///     after the fact.
///   * row 14: FL's state-blob format diverges enough from reference VST3
///     that the `MemoryStream`-shaped reader path fails outright. The
///     adapter must skip that reader and fall through to a tolerant
///     unknown-format reader so FL sessions deserialize cleanly.
///
/// Version handling: both quirks have been present across every FL
/// Studio VST3 vintage Pulp encounters (the Patcher contract issue is
/// architectural; the state-blob divergence predates the 20.x window
/// and is still present). `apply_fl_studio` fires both flags regardless
/// of `HostVersion`. If a future FL release fixes either, add an
/// `is_before(major)` guard at that point.
///
/// **Reference-Lineage**: cleanroom reproducer=macos-plan-item-5.7
