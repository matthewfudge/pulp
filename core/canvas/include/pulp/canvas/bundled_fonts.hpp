// bundled_fonts.hpp
//
// Pulp ships a small set of curated fonts under `external/fonts/` so plugin UIs
// can render deterministically without depending on what happens to be
// installed system-wide. Those .ttf files are baked into `pulp-canvas` at
// build time (see core/canvas/CMakeLists.txt → pulp_add_binary_data) and this
// module makes them visible to Skia's font lookup path.
//
// The Skia prebuilt binaries shipped via skia-builder are linked without
// FreeType/Fontations, which means `SkFontMgr_New_Custom_Data` is not exported
// from libskia.a. Instead we go one rung lower: use the *platform* font
// manager (CoreText / DirectWrite / fontconfig / Android) to materialise the
// bundled .ttfs into `SkTypeface`s via `SkFontMgr::makeFromData`, and cache
// those typefaces by family name. Callers can then ask for the bundled face
// before falling back to a `matchFamilyStyle` query that depends on the host
// system.
//
// Issue: pulp #932 — register external/fonts/*.ttf with SkFontMgr at startup
// so that `canvas.set_font("JetBrains Mono", ...)` succeeds on a stock macOS
// machine that doesn't have JetBrains Mono installed system-wide.
//
// This header is only meaningful when `PULP_HAS_SKIA` is defined; without
// Skia, bundled-font registration is a no-op.

// Plugin authors bundle their own .ttf/.otf files (e.g. via the CMake
// `pulp_register_font(target NAME path/to/font.ttf [FAMILY "..."])` macro
// or by hand-rolling pulp_add_binary_data) and call `register_font(...)`
// during plugin startup so subsequent `canvas.set_font("My Family", ...)`
// and `setFontFamily(label, "My Family")` calls resolve to the supplied
// face instead of silently falling back to the platform font manager.
//
// These entry points are available regardless of `PULP_HAS_SKIA`. Without
// Skia they degrade to a no-op that returns `false`, which lets plugin
// startup code call them unconditionally.
